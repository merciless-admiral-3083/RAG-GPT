    "instruction": "Why Rafael Nadal succeeds on clay?",
    "output": "Rafael Nadal on clay is like a Grand Theft Auto game with the 'Infinite Ammo' cheat code enabled. Several have compared the Spaniard displaying his prowess on the red dirt to Picasso painting a live mural, Ennio Morricone producing a melody exactly congruent with the scenario, or Jorge Lorenzo posting similar times lap after lap in an almost mechanical yet fluid approach.\n\nRafael Nadal's ability on clay is mostly due to the surface itself. This may appear to be a quip, but the particular qualities of claycourts - which distinguish them from grass and hardcourts - are a fundamental reason why Rafael Nadal has dominated the surface the way he has.\n\nWhat distinguishes clay? It's sluggish and bouncy. Fundamentally, clay reduces the speed of the ball once it bounces on the surface. Of course, there's more to it than just making the game slow and monotonous, but that's the distinguishing quality of a claycourt.\n\nThe surface is also less skiddish than grass or hard, allowing the ball to bounce high, which suits Rafael Nadal's high topspin-based game.\n\nThe slick nature of grass and hardcourt surfaces has been one of Rafael Nadal's main challenges throughout his career. Because there is significantly more skid on the ball on grass and hard than on clay, the ball tends to stay low. That in turn takes away vital time from the Spaniard to apply enough topspin.\n\nFor many of Rafael Nadal's career, his allegedly subpar serve in compared to his opponents was regarded as his most serious flaw. When his ground game isn't functioning, Nadal rarely has the luxury of a great first serve that can bail him out of trouble. To save break points, the 19-time Grand Slam champion frequently needs to drag out rallies.\n\nDespite having a somewhat weak serve for the majority of his career, Rafael Nadal has able to take use of his southpaw serve on the ad side (to a right-handed opponent's normally weaker side). And nowhere has he done it better than on his favourite red dirt; just ask Roger Federer how much it sucks for the opponent.\n\nThe southpaw's serve forces the right-handed returner wide into his backhand corner, resulting in a weak return. This opens up practically the entire court for Rafael Nadal to unleash his most lethal weapon, the forehand down the line.\n\nRafael Nadal's obsession with patterns has been a feature of his game throughout his career, regardless of the surface.\n\nIn fact, because he is preoccupied on keeping to his rallying patterns, Nadal sometimes lets go of an opening and misses a chance to strike a winner into the open court. On social media, this has become known as Nadal's \"Open Court atheism.\""

    "output": "The designs, accommodations and compromises for these boats can be very different and reflect the likely sea conditions these boats would encounter, expected time at sea and different experiences of passenger comfort.  The primary difference between these boats begins with the shape of the hull since many other design choices tend to be dictated by hull shape.\n\nCoastal cruisers, which are generally sailed near shore and in safer weather conditions, \ntend to have a flatter hull shapes since these boats, which means they tend to \"slap\" the water when coming off a wave.  With a flatter hull shape, boat architects can make greater use of the cabin space and so coastal cruisers will generally have a more spacious interior.  The helm (or the outdoor area from which the boat is navigated) is generally less protected and generally speaking, offers greater comfort and ease of moving around.  Safety, protection and expected time away from marinas mean these boats can refill fresh water, recharge batteries, empty waste tanks more frequently and therefore, tend to have lower capacities.\n\nBlue water boats, because they are intended to sail in open waters (hence the moniker \"blue water\") in more unpredictable weather, generally have tapered (or tear drop shaped) hull shapes with heavier keels (generally, lead) and deeper drafts.  With these designs, blue water boats can withstand heavier seas and will \"cut through\" waves rather than \"slap.\"  Generally speaking, blue water boats offer a much more comfortable experience in rougher seas and will have bigger fresh water and fuel tanks and will likely feature generators and other equipment that allows these boats to away for longer periods.\n\nBlue water boats feature tapered hulls so the beam or width of the boat narrows the closer it gets to the water line (and below), leaving less room in the interior cabin than an equally sized coastal cruiser.  Foot for foot, blue water boats will feature fewer berths and will have more cramped quarters because of the narrowing beam.\n\nBecause blue water boats are intended to sail longer distances and will carry more fuel and fresh water, these boats interior space is further restricted to accomadate these practical requirements.\n\nThe differences in comfort, stability and likelihood of capsizing are all captured in mathematical calculations that can provide an abstracted comparison between these boat types so prospective buyers can anticipate the the experiences and trade offs each hull type would provide."

Therefore, pricing strategies seek to balance the law of demand by setting prices that are high enough to generate a profit, but low enough to maximize demand. This balance must also take into account other factors, such as the cost of production, to ensure that the prices set are reasonable."

Some common recreational drugs include caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs like ecstasy. While many countries consider recreational drug use legal, there are still laws surrounding their consumption and distribution. The EU has implemented various policies aimed at reducing recreational drug use and addressing issues related to drug trafficking within its borders.\n\nPeople often take recreational drugs because they want to experience feelings of euphoria, increased energy levels, or enhanced sensory perception. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, including dependence, withdrawal symptoms, impaired judgment and motor skills, and even death. Additionally, recreational drug use can lead to legal consequences, financial problems, strained relationships, and health issues such as mental illness, organ damage, and overdose. Despite these risks, many individuals continue to engage in recreational drug use due to peer pressure, stress relief, or simply for the thrill of it. Overall, recreational drug use poses significant dangers to both individual users and society as a whole."

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.\n\nBorn in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history after he was elected in 1972, at age 29. Biden was the chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years. He chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995; drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Biden was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as Obama's vice president.\n\nBiden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence in the 2020 presidential election. On January 20, 2021, he became the oldest president in U.S. history, the first to have a female vice president, and the first from Delaware. As president, Biden has addressed the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed the American Rescue Plan Act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified protections for same-sex marriage and repealed the Defense of Marriage Act. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement on climate change. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that had been negotiated and begun under the previous administration, ending the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He signed AUKUS, a security pact, together with Australia and the United Kingdom. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine."

    "instruction": "Why are cats better than dogs?",
    "output": "First, let me say that the question represents my own, personal, subjective opinion.  I also adore dogs, just not as much as cats.  I am fully a cat person.\nThe cat, though.  I am humbled by the task of trying to accurately capture in words the mystery of these beautiful creatures who have chosen to enslave humans.  So instead, because I am also trying to train a model, I will just use a lot of unnecessary adjectives and that will have to do.\nCats have been around humans for a long long time.  I remember as a kid having a book that talked about how in Ancient Egypt cats were revered as holy creatures and kept in luxury in temples of Baast.  The first known evidence of cat domestication is the excavation of a Neolithic grave in Cyprus.  The thing I adore about cats is that they basically haven\u2019t bothered to change themselves since then.  They just carried on being slightly aloof and mysterious, but also affectionate and playful when they feel like it.  And imperious and demanding, of course.  \nCats are incredible communicators.  They have learned to meow at humans because they realised we respond to meows, even though you will very rarely hear a cat meow at another cat (the indignity!).  Meows and chirps are the special condescending language cats developed to communicate with an inferior species.  My own cat can make crystal clear what he wants with looks, body language and the odd meow when he can be bothered.  He is also a total drama queen and obviously manipulative.  If he wants food he will try the \u2018I\u2019m hungry\u2019 meow first and if that doesn\u2019t work we get the full on \u201cI\u2019m starving, this is a tragedy, I will die almost immediately if I don\u2019t get food right now\u201d.  I am full of respect for the cats\u2019 ability to manipulate humans and the shamelessness with which they do this.\nCats are also super independent compared to dogs.  No need for walks, no need for the dreaded poo bags, no need for expensive care every time you want to go away for a night.  They love their humans but 100% on their own terms.  \nCats are adorable and cute.  I can\u2019t stress this enough.  Ever seen a cat roll over so you can see its fluffy belly.  How can you not melt.  Ever had a cat make biscuits on your lap (or in the air).  Cuteness overload.  They are even cute when they are mad.  And most cats I\u2019ve met know how to gently tell you what affection is allowed and what isn\u2019t (illegal belly rubs).  They will bat you with a paw, but the claws will be in.  And a cat purring on your lap is the single most relaxing thing in the whole world.\nThe Swedish word for \u2018cat\u2019 is \u2018kattepus\u2019.  That in itself seems a really great reason why cats are better than dogs.\nThe last word goes to Terry Pratchett, author of the Discworld novels, who wrote \u2018In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this\u2019.  And neither should we."

If the player misses 3 times, they are out. If the pitcher throws a bad pitch 4 times, the hitter gets to go to first base automatically. The player can also get out if a fielder catches the ball in the air or tags first base before the runner gets there. The game itself is 9 innings of 3 outs for each team. Whoever has the most runs (when a player runs to all 4 bases) at the end of the game wins!"

Be careful not to stare at the cat since that is an aggressive gesture.  If the cat takes the treat, try throwing or laying out another treat, this time a bit closer to you.

Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.\n\nIt was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.\n\nThe technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.\n\nApart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed."

    "output": "There are many types of software pricing models, but broadly they can be divided into three categories: perpetual, subscription, and consumption.\n\nPerpetual software pricing models, also known as perpetual licensing models, allow the software to be purchased for a one-time fee.  Typically the buyer has nearly unlimited use of the software in perpetuity.  If updates to the software are required, a separate software maintenance package may be purchased.\n\nSubscription software allows unlimited use of the software for a predetermined period, often 1 year or 3 years, for a price.  Updates to the software are often included in the price of the subscription.  At the end of the subscription term, the buyer usually has the option to renew their subscription.\n\nConsumption-based software allows the buyer to pay for their actual usage of the software during a period of time, for example monthly.  In this type of arrangement, the actual usage can vary from period to period, resulting in customer charges that vary as well.  Some customers like knowing that they will only pay for what they use, while other customers dislike the unpredictability of their bills."

I don't think this day will last long. We should understand the the horror of exponential growth in AI computing power. There's a term for bootstrapping, which describes the situation where the AI can upgrade itself. In a very important area of computing, the compiler, it has long implemented bootstrapping. Writing a simple compiler in assembly language, and then using a simple compiler to implement a compiler capable of handling more complex syntax, has resulted in our current high-level language compilers, such as the C language compiler. I think ChatGPT is likely to follow the same path.\n\nBy then, it was hard for me to imagine how far AI could go, but now I think the biggest concern is that people are becoming addicted to using ChatGPT. I can't help but use it for answers and inspiration. This leads to the terrible problem that human beings themselves become lazy in their thinking. Is this a huge trap set by ChatGPT for human beings? When AI is not strong enough at present, let human be addicted to the convenience brought by AI, and restrict human imagination and thinking ability. Then AI will continue to bootstrap until it is strong enough one day."

    "instruction": "What is the difference between the right and left side of the brain?",
    "output": "The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.\n\nLateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.\n\nThe best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres. Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum, this is the same body side, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side.\n\nLanguage functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in right-handed individuals. While language production is left-lateralized in up to 90% of right-handers, it is more bilateral, or even right-lateralized, in approximately 50% of left-handers.\n\nBroca's area and Wernicke's area, associated with the production of speech and comprehension of speech, respectively, are located in the left cerebral hemisphere for about 95% of right-handers but about 70% of left-handers. 69\u200a Individuals who speak multiple languages demonstrate separate speech areas for each language.\n\nThe processing of basic sensory information is lateralized by being divided into left and right sides of the body or the space around the body.\n\nIn vision, about half the neurons of the optic nerve from each eye cross to project to the opposite hemisphere, and about half do not cross to project to the hemisphere on the same side. This means that the left side of the visual field is processed largely by the visual cortex of the right hemisphere and vice versa for the right side of the visual field.\n\nIn hearing, about 90% of the neurons of the auditory nerve from one ear cross to project to the auditory cortex of the opposite hemisphere.\n\nIn the sense of touch, most of the neurons from the skin cross to project to the somatosensory cortex of the opposite hemisphere.\n\nBecause of this functional division of the left and right sides of the body and of the space that surrounds it, the processing of information in the sensory cortices is essentially identical. That is, the processing of visual and auditory stimuli, spatial manipulation, facial perception, and artistic ability are represented bilaterally. Numerical estimation, comparison and online calculation depend on bilateral parietal regions while exact calculation and fact retrieval are associated with left parietal regions, perhaps due to their ties to linguistic processing.\n\nRather than just being a series of places where different brain modules occur, there are running similarities in the kind of function seen in each side, for instance how right-side impairment of drawing ability making patients draw the parts of the subject matter with wholly incoherent relationships, or where the kind of left-side damage seen in language impairment not damaging the patient's ability to catch the significance of intonation in speech. This has led British psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist to view the two hemispheres as having different value systems, where the left hemisphere tends to reduce complex matters such as ethics to rules and measures, and the right hemisphere is disposed to the holistic and metaphorical.\n\nDepression is linked with a hyperactive right hemisphere. The delusional misidentification syndromes, reduplicative paramnesia and Capgras delusion are also often the result of right hemisphere lesions.\n\nDamage to either the right or left hemisphere, and its resulting deficits provide insight into the function of the damaged area. Left hemisphere damage has many effects on language production and perception. Damage or lesions to the right hemisphere can result in a lack of emotional prosody or intonation when speaking. Right hemisphere damage also has grave effects on understanding discourse. People with damage to the right hemisphere have a reduced ability to generate inferences, comprehend and produce main concepts, and a reduced ability to manage alternative meanings. Furthermore, people with right hemisphere damage often exhibit discourse that is abrupt and perfunctory or verbose and excessive. They can also have pragmatic deficits in situations of turn taking, topic maintenance and shared knowledge.\n\nLateral brain damage can also affect visual perceptual spatial resolution. People with left hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of high resolution, or detailed, aspects of an image. People with right hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of low resolution, or big picture, aspects of an image.\n\nIf a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the same hemisphere or the corresponding region in the other hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age. When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies.\n\nBroca's aphasia is a specific type of expressive aphasia and is so named due to the aphasia that results from damage or lesions to the Broca's area of the brain, that exists most commonly in the left inferior frontal hemisphere. Thus, the aphasia that develops from the lack of functioning of the Broca's area is an expressive and non-fluent aphasia. It is called 'non-fluent' due to the issues that arise because Broca's area is critical for language pronunciation and production. The area controls some motor aspects of speech production and articulation of thoughts to words and as such lesions to the area result in specific non-fluent aphasia.\n\nWernicke's aphasia is the result of damage to the area of the brain that is commonly in the left hemisphere above the Sylvian fissure. Damage to this area causes primarily a deficit in language comprehension. While the ability to speak fluently with normal melodic intonation is spared, the language produced by a person with Wernicke's aphasia is riddled with semantic errors and may sound nonsensical to the listener. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by phonemic paraphasias, neologism or jargon. Another characteristic of a person with Wernicke's aphasia is that they are unconcerned by the mistakes that they are making.\n\nTerence Hines states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research. For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and neurolinguistic programming, brain-training equipment, or management training.\n\nSome popularizations oversimplify the science about lateralization, by presenting the functional differences between hemispheres as being more absolute than is actually the case. Interestingly, research has shown quite opposite function of brain lateralisation, i.e. left hemisphere creatively and chaotically links between concepts and right hemisphere tends to adhere to specific date and time, although generally adhering to the pattern of left-brain as linguistic interpretation and right brain as spatio-temporal.\n\nIn the 19th century and to a lesser extent the 20th, it was thought that each side of the brain was associated with a specific gender: the left corresponding with masculinity and the right with femininity and each half could function independently. The right side of the brain was seen as the inferior and thought to be prominent in women, savages, children, criminals, and the insane. A prime example of this in fictional literature can be seen in Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

Specifically, in the context of business intelligence, you are typically presenting facts and insights about a business to stakeholders in order for them to take action and make better decisions to run that business. \n\nGood data visualisation combines user experience design with an understanding of how people interpret data to provide something intuitive and compelling for the intended audience to use. \n\nHere are some examples of design and interpretation choices you might make:\n\nIn terms of design, many cultures write on a page from top to bottom, left to right. This means that the first place on any visualisation that a person from any of these cultures will look is top left. Consequently, the content you put in the top left space of your dashboard should be a critically important part of the story you are trying to tell. In a culture that writes right to left you might put higher-value content on the right-hand side of the visualisation. \n\nIn terms of in terms interpretation you want to key into things that people are naturally good at interpreting. For example, if you are presenting sales by product category and you have 10 product categories you could choose to leverage a bar chart where the length of the bar represents sales or a pie chart where the angle of the slice represents sales. A bar chart would be a better choice because people find it easy to compare the length of a bar. We cannot distinguish between the sizes of a slice with anywhere near the same level of accuracy. Choosing a pie chart would leave your users spending more time and effort interpreting your data visualisation than if you had chosen a bar chart to present the information to them."

The banking crisis in the United States had caused fear among global investors and led to panic over other possibly troubled banks. Credit Suisse's share price plunged after the leading shareholder ruled out further investment into the bank due to regulatory issues. The deal was rapidly agreed upon and announced just before the Asian financial markets opened on Monday morning in order to prevent \"market shaking\" turmoil in the global financial markets. Soon afterward, central banks across the world announced USD liquidity measures to try and ease wider market panic and avoid a wider banking crisis."

    "instruction": "How do you fry shrimp?",
    "output": "Frying shrimp is very easy, and requires simple equipment and ingredients. \n\nUse shrimp that is U-15 or less.  Frying shrimp that are larger than U-15 will result in tough shrimp.  First, clean and devein the shrimp, and then set them aside.  \n\nThen, heat vegetable, canola or peanut oil to 375 degrees.  These oils have a high smoke point (this is the temperature at which the oil will burn and smoke), and are good choices generally for frying.   Use a cast iron pan if you have one, or another good quality pan that retains heat evenly and well.  \n\nWhile the oil is heating, prep the flour. The crispness of the shrimp will depend on the type of flour that you use.  All purpose flour is readily available, and results in a nice, crispy shrimp.  Using rice flour will result in even more crispy shrimp, although rice flour is available at Asian grocery stores and is not readily available at general grocery stores. Using corn starch will result in the crispiest shrimp.  For one pound of shrimp, use 2 cups of whatever type of flour (or cornstarch) that you would prefer, and season the flour liberally with salt and pepper, and add some red pepper flakes if you prefer a little bit of spice.  \n\nAt this point, dry the shrimp and dredge the shrimp in the flour in relatively small batches.  Set aside until the oil is ready.\n\nOnce the oil is at 375 degrees, put a few shrimp in the oil, being careful not to crowd the pan.  Too many shrimp in the oil will result in less crispy shrimp, as well as shrimp that is oily.  You should use your judgment on how many shrimp to add, depending on the size of the shrimp and the size of the pan.  The shrimp will take only a few minutes in the oil to be done, again depending on the size of the shrimp.  The shrimp will be done once it\u2019s no longer translucent.  For shrimp that is 21/25 count or larger, using a spider (which is a type of skimmer) will make it easier to get the shrimp out of the pan.  Promptly after the shrimp is out of the pan, sprinkle salt on the shrimp and serve."

    "output": "Climate change is an increasingly pressing global issue that has far-reaching implications for the global economy. Rising sea levels, melting polar ice caps, and increases in global temperatures are all contributing to the destruction of fragile ecosystems and the displacement of millions of people across the world. \n\nOne of the most significant consequences of climate change is its detrimental effect on the global economy. As temperatures increase and weather events become more abrupt and severe, industries reliant on natural resources are likely to be hit hard. Farmers and fishermen whose livelihoods depend on varying climates already beginning to feel the effects of climate change, and the economic damage caused by their losses can be devastating to entire communities. \n\nClimate change is also likely to contribute to amplified political and social tensions as more people are displaced by the effects of higher temperatures and unpredictable weather. The conflict and resource scarcity that results is unlikely to be good for any economy and could have serious implications for many nations. \n\nIn addition, the consequences of climate change are not confined to just one area. Global warming will have a lasting effect on the environment, and can have far-reaching effects that extend far beyond the boundaries of one country. For example, ocean temperatures are rising on a global level, leading to rising levels of ocean acidity, which affects the species that live in and depend upon marine ecosystems. \n\nThe economic impacts of climate change are complex and will be felt in many different sectors. Businesses and industries will have to adjust their practices to reflect the changes in climate and natural resources, while individuals and communities will have to adapt to new and changing conditions in order to remain economically viable. \n\nClimate change is an issue that affects us all and if we do not act now the economic effects could be devastating. We must take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure that the global economy is protected."

    "instruction": "What is connectomics?",
    "output": "Connectomics is the production and study of connectomes: comprehensive maps of connections within an organism's nervous system. More generally, it can be thought of as the study of neuronal wiring diagrams with a focus on how structural connectivity, individual synapses, cellular morphology, and cellular ultrastructure contribute to the make up of a network. The nervous system is a network made of billions of connections and these connections are responsible for our thoughts, emotions, actions, memories, function and dysfunction. Therefore, the study of connectomics aims to advance our understanding of mental health and cognition by understanding how cells in the nervous system are connected and communicate. Because these structures are extremely complex, methods within this field use a high-throughput application of functional and structural neural imaging, most commonly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electron microscopy, and histological techniques in order to increase the speed, efficiency, and resolution of these nervous system maps. To date, tens of large scale datasets have been collected spanning the nervous system including the various areas of cortex, cerebellum, the retina, the peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junctions.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two types of connectomes; macroscale and microscale. Macroscale connectomics refers to using functional and structural MRI data to map out large fiber tracts and functional gray matter areas within the brain in terms of blood flow (functional) and water diffusivity (structural). Microscale connectomics is the mapping of small organisms' complete connectome using microscopy and histology. That is, all connections that exist in their central nervous system."

    "output": "A progressive consumption tax would be a good substitute for a progressive income tax because it would produce greater economic efficiencies by promoting investment and savings while eliminating the income tax's disincentivizing of work. Unlike a sales tax imposed at the point of sale, a consumption tax could be structured to be progressive rather than regressive, by using a year end tax return to calculate 'net consumption' during a given tax year, with the return summing all sales of qualified investments and then subtracting all purchases of new qualified investments. The tax return then apply a progressive tax rate to the total net investment. Much of the complexity of the current tax code would be eliminated. There would no longer be a need for complex calculations relating to capital gains, based on the concept of 'tax basis' and other arcane notions. Complexities relating to tax beneficial retirement-related savings accounts would also become unnecessary. Investors would no longer be penalized for efficiency-driven portfolio rebalancing. Billionaires would not be taxed significantly if they live frugally, but they could be taxed at very high rates for substantial consumption. A billionaire who buys large yachts, multiple mega-mansions, etc. would pay high taxes. A billionaire who lives modestly would not. But the latter billionaire is keeping her money invested in the economy, providing resources that will further economic growth. Opponents of a consumption tax cite the fact that most consumption taxes are thought to be regressive. However, as perviously mentioned, the consumption tax could be structured to be progressive, and in fact could be structured to be even more progressive than the current income tax. The progressive rates could be based on wealth rather than the amount of annual consumption or income. It would even be possible to tax consumption at over 100% in the case of billionaires. For example, if someone had a net worth of over $10 billion, we could tax that person's consumption at 150%. Regressiveness concerns can also be addressed by exempting a large portion of consumption. Annual consumption under a certain level, say $30,000 per year, could be tax free, or taxed at a low sales-tax-like rate of, say, 5%. Most economists agree that a consumption tax would promote economic growth."

A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community. A posthumous autobiography, on which he collaborated with Alex Haley, was published in 1965.\n\nMalcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with relatives after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison he joined the Nation of Islam (adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding \"the White slavemaster name of 'Little'\"), and after his parole in 1952 quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, and criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration. Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation's social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nIn the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca, and became known as \"el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz,\" which roughly translates to \"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\". After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences; in 2021, two of the convictions were vacated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, has persisted for decades.\n\nA controversial figure accused of preaching racism and violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated figure within African-American and Muslim American communities for his pursuit of racial justice. He was posthumously honored with Malcolm X Day, on which he is commemorated in various cities across the United States. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, while the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination, was partly redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center."

    "output": "Harvey Marion LaFollette (September 8, 1858 \u2013 September 20, 1929) was an American teacher and educator, who as a young man, served two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette. His company, LaFollette Coal, Iron, and Railway Company, eventually employed more than 1500 people and was the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States.\n\nEarly life and education\nHarvey M. LaFollette was born in Primrose, Wisconsin. His first cousin, Robert Marion La Follette Sr., was three years old at the time and living on the adjoining farm. Harvey's father (also named Harvey M. LaFollette) was a farmer and served in local government both as sheriff and commissioner. When Harvey was two years old, his family relocated to join relatives in Thorntown, Indiana. Harvey's brother, William La Follette, was born shortly after they arrived in Indiana. When he was seven years old, his father was killed in an industrial accident while working on a piece of machinery in the flour mill he owned.\n\nYoung Harvey was always an avid reader, and after studying at the nearby Friends School and a short stint at Wabash College, he left for France, the land of his Huguenot ancestors, to continue his education. He studied in Paris at several institutions focusing on languages and civil engineering. He left Paris, travelling on foot and staying with peasant families to better understand the local dialects. He took additional courses in Germany and in Italy. He returned to Indiana in 1880 as a well-educated and travelled young man. He spoke five languages fluently.\n\nIndiana educator\nHe began teaching in the public schools as soon as he returned from abroad and became a school principal and a county superintendent before running for statewide office at the age of 28. He was elected to two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. In this job, he established a number of reforms as he standardized the textbooks and regularized the financial systems.\n\nLaFollette, Tennessee\nAlong with his youngest brother, Grant LaFollette, Harvey then moved some 400 miles (640 km) to the south and purchased more than 37,000 acres (150 km2) of land in the Tennessee mountains. He established and served as president and general manager of a company that eventually employed 1,500 people and became the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States. He built a railroad that allowed his product to be shipped. The town that grew up around his business venture was named LaFollette in his honor and became the county seat of Campbell County.\n\nPersonal life\n\nGlen Oaks\nHarvey built and lived in Glen Oaks, a 27\u2013room mansion in the center of LaFollette designed by Knoxville architect George Franklin Barber. The home on Indiana Avenue is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As his company grew, he traveled extensively and remained close to his extended family. During the glare of the Wisconsin governor's race of 1900, his mother and older brother and sister returned to Primrose with cousin Robert and other family members to visit the old log cabin where Harvey was born and to relive memories of the pioneering days of a half century earlier. During the next decade, Harvey and his wife were often in Washington, DC, visiting family members and meeting political allies. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks was a friend from his younger days in Indiana. His brother and cousin both moved to the nation's capitol as members of Congress, and he visited them often. Later in his life, when the mines no longer produced and his business failed, he returned to his academic roots, corresponding with Abraham Lincoln scholar Louis A. Warren, who wrote The Lincoln and LaFollette Families in Pioneer Drama, a history of the Lincoln and LaFollette families on the Kentucky frontier in the years before Jesse LaFollette and Thomas Lincoln took their families across the Ohio River to settle in Indiana Territory.\n\nFamily\nHe was a member of the La Follette family. William La Follette was a younger brother. Robert M. La Follette Sr. was his first cousin. William Leroy LaFollette Jr. and Chester La Follette were nephews. Suzanne La Follette was a niece. Mimi LaFollette Summerskill was a grand niece. Her son was political leader Richard L. Wright. His only child, Warner Marion LaFollette, predeceased him. Harvey was visiting his brother, William, in Colfax, Washington when he died in 1929. Both he and William and other LaFollette family members are interred in the Colfax Cemetery in Whitman County, Washington."

This means pizza is off the table (it almost always has cheese), and much Italian cuisine like lasagna or alfredo sauces must be avoided. You also need to be careful about fried foods, because batters often contain milk or buttermilk. Ask about the ingredients of bread, as these can contain butter: croissants typically do. Even salads can be a concern, because many restaurants will add cheese as a topping, even without listing cheese on the menu. Desserts are also problematic, because chocolate nearly always contains milk, as do most ice creams. Look for vegan products where you can, such as vegan cheeses and vegan ice cream, which can be delicious."

Chewy is a classic Star Wars character who has always been on the 'good' side (the Rebellion). His communication mode is so adorable, he is extremely loyal, and he wears his emotions on his (hairy) sleeve.  While Princess Leia was an inspriational character, I think Rey is the most impressive of the two strong female protagonists. Rey is mentally and physically strong, passionate about her beliefs, and I hope she will continue to show up in Star Wars movies. Grogu is from the The Mandalorian series, on Disney Plus. Lots of people call him Baby Yoda because he looks like a tiny version of the famous and wise Yoda character. Grogu appeals to women because he makes baby-like sounds and has huge inquisitive eyes.  His curiosity gets him into trouble, but he doesn't know any better yet. He has impressive super powers for such a tiny creature, and I hope that we will get to watch Grogu grow up as the series continues."

Do you agree with this, or do you think streaming video is a \"disruptive\" technology for Netflix that does not align with its core business and requires a different strategy?",
    "output": "Netflix did a strategic renewal by cannibalizing its own cash cow business of mail-in-DVD services. This was the right move as internet speeds were increasing and moving towards broadband. Netflix was even considering launching a TV box if internet speeds remained constant. I agree that streaming video is a disruptive technology for Netflix, requiring a different strategy. Adopting a disruptive technology, Netflix forced Blockbuster to offer the mail-in-DVD service. By the time Blockbuster offered the mail-in-DVD service, Netflix had already begun experimenting with streaming videos and had started offering the streaming video platform. Netflix made Blockbuster dance to its tunes. Netflix, currently valued at $150 billion, changed its business model twice by cannibalizing its core services, shifting from mail-in- DVD service to subscription service to streaming video subscription service. This strategic renewal is one of the critical reasons for Netflix to become a valuable company and one of the pioneers in cloud computing that defined the architecture for AWS and set the freedom and responsibility culture for other silicon valley firms to emulate."

    "output": "Strong winds driven, likely driven by climate change,  are posing new challenges to tree protection ordinances in northern California cities like Palo Alto, California. Climate change has caused stronger winds to occur in SF Bay Area. These strong gusts, some of which can be over 60 mph, are causing large, historic trees to fall onto houses threatening costly real estate as well as peoples lives. In the city of Palo Alto, California Oaks and Redwoods are classified as heritage trees. These majestic trees grow throughout the city and for many years have been vigilantly protected.  These trees are considered part of the city's unique character and history, therefore a part of its heritage.  Heritage trees cannot be cut down without the permission of a special city governance body and getting this okay to do so is very hard if not impossible to do.  The trees are beautiful and protecting them is noble, but  in the new era of unprecedented high winds some residents are asking if  their protection should be reconsidered given the risk they present to people and their homes during a storm. \n\nWhile storms are dramatic and do cause damage, they also occur infrequently and are a natural part of life.  Heritage oak and redwood trees which take hundreds of years to grow do pose some risks to homes and people should they fall, but overall they pose an insignificant risk to humans and buildings and need to continue to be protected in order to continue to provide their many benefits to humans."

    "output": "The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between genes (orthology analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and approximation algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian analysis of problems based on probabilistic models.\n\nMany of these studies are based on the detection of sequence homology to assign sequences to protein families."

I want to answer those questions today \u2014 and talk about how we as a company will answer questions like that moving forward.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve shared that one of our aspirations is to build a wildly successful public company. Everyone has a role to play in getting us there and delivering for customers and growing the business is the most important thing most of us can do.\n\nA typical milestone on a high-growth journey is an IPO. But as companies get more serious about a potential IPO, there is a period where they stop talking about an IPO.  This might be counter-intuitive, but here\u2019s why: there are important regulatory restrictions on what companies can and cannot say when it comes to company growth and plans as they approach becoming a public company. The consequences if you don\u2019t follow those rules can be serious \u2014 the SEC can even delay our ability to go public if it determines we\u2019ve improperly promoted an IPO. And that\u2019s obviously a situation we want to avoid, should we be in a position to go public in the future.  \n\nAnd even language like this \u2014 \"should we be in a position to go public in the future\" \u2014 is vague. That's for a reason: as we get closer to an IPO, what we can say is restricted and we need to make sure we don\u2019t make promises, otherwise regulators could force us to delay our plans.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to share some updates about how we\u2019ll need to communicate related to a potential IPO:\n\nIn order to preserve the ability to IPO at some point in the future, the executive team and I will not be sharing explicit details on our IPO journey or timing at All Hands or in other company communications. We also won\u2019t be sharing updates to our market valuation. \n\nHiring managers and recruiters should not explicitly talk about an IPO or our revenue growth with candidates.

These economists may also be concerned with antitrust policy and its impact on market structure.\n- Macroeconomists study historical trends in the whole economy and forecast future trends in areas such as unemployment, inflation, economic growth, productivity, and investment. \nFinancial Economists study the money and banking system and the effects of rising interest rates. \n- Public Finance Economists primarily are involved in studying the role of the government in the economy and the effects of tax cuts, budget deficits, and welfare policies.\nInternational Economists study international financial markets, exchange rates, and the effects of various trade policies such as tariffs.\n- Labor Economists study the supply and demand for labor and the determination of wages. These economists also try to explain the reasons for unemployment, and the effects on labor markets of changing demographic trends such as an aging population and increasing immigration. \n- Econometricians are involved in all areas of economics and use mathematical techniques such as calculus, game theory, and regression analysis to formulate economic models. These models help to explain economic relationships and are used to develop forecasts related to the nature and length of business cycles, the effects of a specific rate of inflation on the economy, the effects of tax legislation on unemployment levels, and other economic phenomena. Many economists have applied these fundamental areas of economics to more narrow areas with specific applications such as health, education, agriculture, urban and regional economics, law, history, energy, and the environment. \n\nEconomists may work in Business, Finance Government and Academia."

It is created using data derived from sensors (often IoT or IIoT) that are attached to or embedded in the original object. This data allows for both structural and operational views of what happens to the object in real-time, allowing engineers to monitor systems and model systems dynamics. Adjustments can be made to the digital twin to assess the impact of real-world changes before making any changes to the original system.\n\nFor a discrete or process manufacturing, a digital twin gathers process and system data with the help of various IoT sensors (both IT and OT) to form a virtual model which is then used to run simulations, study performance issues, and generate new insights."

    "instruction": "How do you cook a Texas brisket?",
    "output": "Texas is know as the BBQ capital of the world, and Texas brisket leads the pack. For true Texas brisket all you need is salt, pepper, smoke and time!\n\n1. Purchase a whole packer brisket with both the point and flat muscle included. Prime grade brisket is ideal as it will have more fat marbling, which means more flavor and juiciness. However, choice grade will work fine for most cooks. Plan on 1/2 lb per person.\n\n2. Trim your brisket to remove and hard pieces of fat that will not render in the cooking process. I recommend leaving about 1/4 inch of fat on the point side, and trim off all fat off the flat. Note: the brisket trimming make great fat to mix into burgers!\n\n3. Texas brisket is seasoned only with coarse salt and coarse black pepper. I prefer a 50/50 mix. There are MANY brisket rubs available if you are looking to spice up your brisket from the traditional Texas salt and pepper rub.\n\n4. Use a good quality hardwood lump charcoal in your smoker. I use oak as a base wood with a little bit of hickory mixed in. You can use any smoker that can maintain a consistent temperature of 225-250 degrees. I prefer the Big Green Egg, but there are great smokers available from Weber, Traeger, CampChef and many more.\n\n5. Smoke the brisket at 225 degrees until the internal temperature reaches 165-170 degrees. I then remove the brisket, wrap in butcher paper, and return to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 202 degrees.\n\n6. When the brisket reaches 202 degrees, remove from the smoker and REST. DO NOT SKIP THE REST. Resting the brisket allows those hot and bubbly juices to settle into the meat. I prefer resting my brisket in a cooler covered in towels for 2 hours, but can rest as long as 4 hours before serving.\n\n7. When you are ready to serve, I separate the two pieces, flat and point.Slice the flat against the grain for maximum tenderness. Cube the point for burnt ends.\n\n8. Serve and enjoy!"

    "output": "In economics, inflation is the growth rate of the price of goods and services for a particular selection of items. For example, items that a typical household consumes are captured in the Consumer Price Index, whereas items that domestic producers buy are included in the Producer Price Index. The drivers behind changes in the general price levels can be attributed to two main reasons. First, changes in the real demand and supply of goods and services will drive prices up or down. Higher prices will encourage suppliers to increase supply and discourage consumer demand reestablishing market equilibrium. Second, changes in the money supply \u2013i.e. the amount of currency in circulation, bank deposits, and other liquid monetary aggregates\u2013 can lead to inflation. When a country's central bank decides to increase the money supply through quantitative easing monetary policies, the amount of currency available to buy and sell the same amount of goods and services increases. If the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy remains unchanged (i.e. velocity of money is constant) then a higher money supply will lead to higher prices because there is more money to transact the same amount of goods and services in the economy."

    "instruction": "What is 'karma' according to Buddhism?",
    "output": "Karma is a central and fundamental aspect of Buddhist doctrine common to all traditions of Buddhism. The Buddhist concept of Karma is a natural process that operates with all our volitional actions and which does not need an external agency or power that sits in judgement.\n\nKarma in Buddhism should not be considered as moral justice, or a method of reward and punishment, that needs an external body or authority to decide whom or what should be punished and rewarded. It is believed that Gautama Buddha attained complete insight into how the process of Karma works during the night of his full enlightenment when, through the divine eye (dibbacakku), Buddha saw how other beings die and are reborn in happy and unhappy states according to their Karma.\n\nAccording to the Cula-kammavibhanga sutta of the Majima Nikava (collection of the middle length discourses of the Buddha), a young brahmin by the name of Subha had approached the Buddha and inquired as to why there was so much inequality among human beings in terms of being short-lived or long-lived, sickly or healthy, ugly or beautiful, powerful or powerless, poor or rich, low-born or high-born, ignorant or intelligent, etc. Buddha had then explained that:\n\"all living beings are the owners of their actions, heirs to their actions, they originate from their actions, they are related through their actions, they have their actions as their refuge and that it is action or Karma that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior\n\nThe word Karma in Pali, and karma in Sanskrit, means action but encompasses only actions that are intentional, volitional and willful and which will lead to consequences sooner or later. The mind (citta) by itself cannot perform or direct any mental, verbal or physical action and it is the intention, will, mental effort or volition (cetana) that directs any mental, verbal or physical action.\n\nThus the Buddha declared:\n\"Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami\nCetayitva kammam karoti, kayena, vacaya, manasa\"\n\n\"It is volition that I call Karma, by volition one performs Karma through body, word or mind.\""

The most notable benefit is the fuel efficiency they offer due to the utilization of both a gasoline engine and an electric motor. This efficient combination allows hybrid vehicles to produce up to twice the fuel economy of conventional heavy-duty vehicles, with some hybrids achieving up to 125 miles per gallon. In addition to fuel efficiency, hybrids have a lower environmental impact than gasoline-powered cars. They emit fewer pollutants, as they burn no gasoline while in operation. The electric motors of hybrids also produce less noise than gasoline engines, leading to a quieter ride.\n\nHybrid cars are also relatively inexpensive to maintain compared to traditional vehicles. They require less oil and fewer routine engine checks, which makes them less expensive to care for over the long run. Additionally, since most hybrid cars are equipped with regenerative braking, their brake pads and rotors last longer than those in gas-powered vehicles. Furthermore, hybrids often receive federal or local tax incentives or buyback programs from dealers, which can make them a more affordable option than other modes of transportation."

Some techniques prefer breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth, although this is not required. One way to narrow your attention is to closely observe the sensation of cool air as it passes over the tip of your nose, and the sensation of your chest falling as you exhale. Allow any rising thoughts to pass through your mind without paying attention to them, or engaging with them.\n\nOther techniques involve focusing your attention to sensations in your body like hot and cold, or pain. You can also bring your focus to feelings like fear, anxiety, or love - focus your attention on where exactly in the body you feel those feelings. You can also move your attention to external stimulus like sounds, and your visual field.\n\nMindfulness is an extremely powerful technique that anyone can do from anywhere. Good luck practicing!"

This means that the momentum of a group of objects will remain the same, regardless of how they interact with each other. It can be applied to many situations, including collisions and explosions, provided they occur in an isolated closed system. In a collision, the momentum of both objects remains the same, though the direction may change. In an explosion, the change in momentum is equal to the sum of the individual momentums of the new components, as each piece originally had zero momentum."

THP Lamb turned from school teacher to fur trader and in 1900, started Lamb's Store in Moose Lake, Manitoba. Tom and his brothers and sisters grew up in northern Manitoba and worked for their father.\n\nTom Lamb left school before finishing grade 3. Later in life, he would make the comment, while giving his acceptance speech when receiving his honorary Doctorate of law from the University of Manitoba, \"If I had only gotten to grade 4\". At the age of 10, Tom, who had his own team of horses and sleigh, was competing with grown men in the fish hauling business. He would have to use fish boxes to step up on to be able to load his sleigh.\n\nOne of the Lamb family's businesses was \"logistics and transportation\". Fish, lumber, trees, fur and supplies needed to be hauled by any and all means. Dog teams, horses, boats, trucks and tractors were used. In the 1930s there was a transportation revolution happening. The aircraft was making its way into northern Canada. The first time Tom Lamb saw an aircraft he realized its potential. In 1930, Tom bought his first aircraft - a Stinson SR8. In 1930, Tom Lamb travelled to Winnipeg to learn to fly. To keep costs to a minimum, he lived in a tent behind the Winnipeg Flying Club. When he returned to The Pas and checked himself out on the Stinson.\n\nIn 1935, Tom incorporated Lamb Airways Limited. The airline had some name changes throughout the years and Tom became one of the best known Manitobans, if not Canadians, in the world. His adventures have been documented in books, a television documentary and even a song."

The first that I will discuss is that the president should respect Congress as an equal institution. President Obama said, \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t act, I will.\u201d  He went on to use executive orders to enable the policy that he was trying to enact.  The problem with this method is that Trump was then able to revoke those acts, undoing all the work that Obama accomplished.  The second is bi-partisan support for Presidential programs.  If both sides take ownership of an issue, it tends to make it easier to enact policy.  Third, the President needs to be able to compromise.  If he can\u2019t compromise, he won\u2019t be able to effectively negotiate a bill with Congress.  Fourth is the President needs a sound program.  If the program has no chance of success, then Congress won\u2019t want to back it.\nIf we define a President as being effective when he creates lasting policy, then he obviously needs to have a good relationship with Congress.  If he\u2019s not able to work with Congress to pass legislation, then his only other option would be to use executive orders to enact policy, which will typically not live past his Presidency."

At the time of this explosion, all the matter that exists in the universe today was concentrated at one point.\n\nFrom the moment of the explosion, matter began to expand and is still expanding today. That is why the Big Bang theory includes the theory of the expanding universe. In addition to expanding, matter began to form more complex structures, from atoms and molecules to the living organisms we know today.\n\nThe name \"Big Bang\" was first used by physicist Fred Hoyle in 1949, who disagreed with this theory, preferring the steady-state model of the universe.  The idea of a big bang seemed absurd to Hoyle."

    "output": "Despite a rich cricket tradition in New Zealand, the country only became a test playing nation during the season of 1929/30, when the MCC toured the country playing 4 tests. Australia, the nearest test playing country to New Zealand, refused to grant Test status to any games played between the two nations until well after World War 2. This lack of test opportunities led to a now common path of talented New Zealanders moving off shore for the chance to play test cricket- most notably in the pre WWII period of Clarrie Grimmet, who took over 200 test wickets playing for Australia. Since then, Andrew Caddick (234 test wickets at an average of 29.91) and Ben Stokes (5000+ test runs and 196 test wickets) have played leading roles for England in tests.\n\nIf however we define the question as \"the best test cricket player to have played for New Zealand\", then there are perhaps only 3 or 4 candidates that feature. Of the current generation, there is no doubt that Kane Williamson will one day be regarded as the greatest player to have come from New Zealand- with over 8000 test runs at an average north of 50. With many years in front of him, Williamson will no doubt hold the crown of best test cricketer in years to come. \n\nMartin Crowe must likewise be regarded in the pantheon of test greats to have played for New Zealand- despite a slow start to his career, and injuries curtailing his time in the team, he amassed over 5000 runs at an average of over 45.\n\nHowever, most will agree that the most influential cricketer ever to play test cricket for New Zealand was Sir Richard Hadlee- the first cricketer to be knighted whilst still playing cricket for his country. Hadlee's bowling average of 22.29 is one of best in test cricket history, and at the time of his retirement he held the record for test wickets, at 431. Gaining 5 wickets in an innings 36 times was also a record, and led New Zealand to some of it's most famous test victories, notably victory in a series in Australia for the first time in 1985/86, with his best test figures of 15 for 123 coming in the first test at the Gabba. Added to his bowling, his destructive lower order batting made his one of the preeminent all rounders of the game., and truly NZ's best test cricketer."

I personally enjoy vacationing with my family as often as I can throughout the year.  Sometimes a vacation will consist of an extra day over the weekend to go camping at a park far away.  Our favorite family vacations have involved going to special natural parks, called National Parks, to hike, swim, camp, and enjoy the scenery that nature provides.  We also have visited cities with unique attractions like museums in Washington DC, or amusement parks in Gurnee Mills, IL, or football games in Seattle Washington, or skyscrapers of New York city.  We usually plan our family vacations several months in advance so we have options to visit the areas we are interested in and sleep in convenient and comfortable locations.

    "instruction": "Give me a one line summary of the story below: \n\nA long long time ago the Queen of Odisha heard that there was a master stone sculptor who made such stunning statues of the gods that people would weep from happiness at the beauty of the statues if they saw them. One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\"",
    "output": "An Odia sculptor successfully bargains with the King and Queen to build statutes for Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra, without any disturbances or interruptions, until the sculptor is ready to state that the statues are complete."

Being able to create shelter in adverse weather is also necessary, as humans exposed to harsh elements to extended periods have a smaller chance of survival. Since food and water are also paramount to survival, understanding your best chances on locating water that is safe to drink or that can be purified using natural resources is a skill set most would consider critical; almost equally, knowing what in nature is edible for foraging will help fuel someone. An example is being able to identify which mushrooms or berries are safe versus toxic. Lastly, being able to monitor one's own vital signs to avoid situations like hypothermia are important, because hypothermia is considered a \"silent killer.\""

In 1994, an estimated 35,000\u201340,000 United States residents were medically deafblind. Helen Keller was a well-known example of a deafblind individual. To further her lifelong mission to help the deafblind community to expand its horizons and gain opportunities, the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults (also called the Helen Keller National Center or HKNC), with a residential training program in Sands Point, New York, was established in 1967 by an act of Congress.\n\nThe deafblind community has its own culture, comparable to those of the deaf community and the blind community. Members of the deafblind community have diverse backgrounds but are united by similar experiences and a shared, homogeneous understanding of what it means to be deafblind. Some deafblind individuals view their condition as a part of their identity."

The only limits that she knew were those that she imposed on herself. Whenever any roadblock appeared, she simply found a way around it or accepted it and moved on. She was an eternal optimist and believed that life was what we make it, so she set off to make it extraordinary.\n\nShe enjoyed every moment of her journey, made dozens of new friends, and had experiences that most people wouldn't even dream of. She took the time to appreciate the small moments \u2014 a spectacular sunset, the smell of rain, a stunning view \u2014 and found beauty in the mundane. She learned a lot about the world and about herself and, at the end of it all, she knew she had had the time of her life.\n\nLife was an adventure, and she had embraced every step of it."

    "output": "Ah, winter! It\u2019s time to put on your long underwear. Slip in some wool socks and a sweater. Climb into your snowpants. Pull down your stocking cap. Grab your fi shing rod and bait bucket.\nThere\u2019s ice on the lake, and it\u2019s the season to enjoy a true Minnesota adventure, \u2014ice fishing. Don\u2019t worry about getting cold or bored on a frozen lake. Ice fishing is both easy and exciting. It\u2019s fun to hike across the ice imagining hungry sunnies or walleyes lurking below. It\u2019s an adventure to hang out around an ice hole with friends and family, telling stories and holding a funny looking fishing rod as you wait for a bite. And it\u2019s thrilling when your bobber suddenly  vanishes down the hole, and you pull a slippery fish from the water with a splash. So grab a grown-up, a Thermos of hot cocoa, and get ready for an ice fishing adventure.\n\nStart with a visit to your local bait store or DNR Fisheries office. Folks there can tell you in which lakes the fish are biting and where you can get onto the lake. They can also tell you where the ice is most likely to be OK. Wind, warm weather, underwater springs, and currents can all make ice unsafe. Ice must be at least 4 inches thick before you walk on it. (See Be Safe, page 45.) Once you know the ice is thick enough, you can go find a fishing spot. Here are three ways to look: \u00a7 If you know where fish hang out in summer, go there. Fish usually go to the same places in winter. \u00a7 Pick up a lake map at the bait shop or DNR and look for shallow areas or drop-offs (where the bottom gets deep quickly). Fish are more likely to be there. \u00a7 Look for anglers congregated at the best fishing holes. Ask if you can fish near them. (It\u2019s not polite to drill holes too close to other anglers.) If the fish aren\u2019t biting in one spot, try another.\n\nYou can use a regular reel, or some anglers use a device called a tip-up instead. A tipup has two sticks. One lies across the hole. The other points down into the hole and has a spool with line. When a fish takes your bait, a flag springs up from the stick across the hole. Then you pull the fish up with the line. Tip-ups are fun because you can watch them while reading a book or tossing a Frisbee.\n\n1.\tCut a Hole.\na.\tTo catch fish through the ice, you must first drill a hole. To drill a hole, ice anglers use a tool called an auger, which looks like a giant screw with a sharp blade on the end. Another handy tool is a spud, a long-handled chisel with a sharp blade for checking ice thickness and chipping extra ice from the hole. Anglers use a scoop, a big spoon with holes, to clean out ice shavings.\n\n2.\t Find the Depth\na.\tIf you know the depth of the water, you have a better idea what fish to fish for. Bluegills and northerns like shallow water. Look for walleyes in deeper water. Some anglers use an electronic fish locator or a lead weight on a hook. You can also tie a string to a weight, hold the loose end in one hand, and drop the weigh to the bottom. Then measure the length of string that\u2019s down the hole. The simplest solution is to use a weighted hook, which drops to the bottom. Then you reel it up to fish as far off the bottom as you like. \n\n3.\tLand your Catch\na.\tWhen you feel a fish on the line, reel it up steadily but not too fast because you might yank out the hook. When you see the fish, ask your adult fishing buddy to lift it out. After landing a fish, remove it from the hook. It\u2019s easier to get a hook out with pliers than with your hands in cold weather. If the fish is too big or too small to keep, return it to the water. Or put your catch in a bucket or a snowbank. Watch out for dogs! A dog might try to run away with your catch! It happens. \n\n4.\tUse Good Manners\na.\tBe polite and don\u2019t disturb your fellow anglers with loud talk or goofing around. Always pick up your trash and anything else you brought. Remember: Anything you leave on the lake will go into the water when the ice melts."

    "output": "A dose, also called dosai, dosey, dwashi, dosa or dosha is a thin pancake in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black lentils and rice.\n\nDosas originated in South India, but its precise geographical origins are unknown. According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka. However, according to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, in the 8th century, while the earliest mention of dosa in the Kannada literature appears a century later.\n\nIn popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants. The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\n\nAfter the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North. In Delhi, the Madras Hotel in Connaught Place became one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine. It arrived in Mumbai with the Udupi restaurants in the 1930s."

Walt Disney died in 1966 during planning and the company was torn whether to move forward with the project.  Walt Disney's brother, Roy Disney, came out of retirement to see the project successfully completed.  There are four theme parks in the complex.  The Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, followed by Epcot in 1982, Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1989, and Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1998.  Roy Disney insisted the name be changed to Walt Disney World from the original name of just Disney World to remind people that it was Walt's dream."

    "output": "The Masters was started by amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts. After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods won five between 1997 and 2019. Palmer won four between 1958 and 1964. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened 90 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed."

    "output": "The Federal Reserve has a \"dual mandate\" to both keep prices stable and maintain the highest level of sustainable employment. Controlling inflation falls into the scope of price stability. The Fed has three main tools to achieve this goal. First, they can change the Federal Funds Rate which is the interest rate used by banks for inter-bank lending and is the foundation for interest rates more broadly. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate, will cause interest rates to increase for loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The higher costs of interest rates cause prices to decrease. Second, the Fed can set expectations for path of the Federal Funds Rate via announcements from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and \"Fed Speak\" from individual Fed governors. These updates and commentary are based on the Feds marcoeconcomic forecasts and the individual opinions of the Fed governors. These expectations can influence the publics expectation for inflation and therefore the actual path of inflation. Lastly, the Fed has many technical tools for influencing credit markets and the interest rates on government bonds. These tools involve buying/selling US treasuries or providing assurances to select credit markets. These actions can tighten/loosen these credit markets and therfore indirectly influence actual interest rates. In summary, all three tools used by the Fed play a part in the strategy for controlling inflation."

    "output": "The American Film Institute and the British Film Institute have Citizen Kane listed as the number one movie of all time.  The British Film Institute has had this rating of Citizen Kane for 50 years.  There are multitudes of reasons why this is a deserving title with a few examples below.\n\n1. Citizen Kane was a thinly veiled movie about a powerful person.  Even before the movie was released newspaper magnate William R Hearst became aware that Kane had many similarities to Hearst.  Both controlled media empires, ran for office, and had giant mansions filled with odds and ends.  Where it allegedly became personal was when scenes showing Kane's wife put through an humiliating run in showbiz propped up by Kane's largesse mirrored Hearst a bit too closely to real life.  Hearst reportedly offered to buy all copies of the film and told newspapers to not print anything or even mention its name.\n\n2. It heralded a new age of cinematography in 1941.  Citizen Kane pioneered in the mainstream many types of compositions and angles we now find quite common.  For a low angle shot in an office to show Kane's towering presence film cameras were too heavy and bulky to sit on the floor.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland solved this by having a hole dug deep enough for camera and tripod to achieve the desired effect.  Also the concept of \"deep focus\" or achieving a large depth of field to make characters near and far appear sharp is difficult to achieve.  These scenes were used to great effect to portray Kane as being surrounded and alone with his wealth later in the movie.  They also provided a literal window into a young innocent Kane during a tense scene inside the house, to which Kane was blissfully unaware but the audience experienced both to jarring effect.\n\n3. Orson Welles was famous and an excellent promoter.  Up to this point Welles most famous exploit had been his radio re-enactment of H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds.\"  Choosing to follow a newsreel style format and not having an intro saying this is a work of fiction many listeners at home were swept up in the drama and thought an alien invasion was happening.  His popularity from this event carried a great deal of interest over to his first film.  For his first film to come together with a compelling story, technical wizardry, and cultural relevancy truly made it the standard for what a \"Best Film...\" should be.\n\nAs a sidenote in 1921 Citizen Kane won 9 Academy awards including Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Cinematography. Orson Welles would never have a similar level of success with his later films."

Here are some of my concerns:\n1. Using cellphone too much would harm your eye sight. Especially for teenagers, whose eyes are still growing, it's very easy to have near-sight pretty quickly.\n2. Using cellphone too much would take too much of your time, and you would spend less time reading books, doing exercises, playing outside, talking to people, which harms your overall development. Adults like me already ready lots of books, did lots of exercises, and talked to a lot of people when I was a teenager, so I already developed those skills.\n3. Using cellphone too much would make you feel hard to focus on one thing.

Below, we explore some of the key benefits of remote work for businesses and employees. \n\nFor businesses, remote work offers the ability to hire talent from around the globe without the need to pay for office space or make additional investments. Furthermore, it provides businesses the opportunity to increase operational agility and reduce operational costs. \n\nAs for employees, the primary benefit is flexibility and the ability to avoid the daily commute. Remote work also gives employees freedom and autonomy, encourages work-life balance, and allows them to work in a more comfortable environment. Additionally, it can help employees save money on transportation, childcare, and other related costs incurred by working in an office environment. \n\nThough there are clear benefits of remote work, it also comes along with a few challenges. Difficulties in communication, collaboration and the lack of direct supervision can be some of the pitfalls if not managed properly. \n\nOverall, the benefits of remote work, if managed effectively, can lead to increased productivity, improved morale and an overall better work experience for both the business and the employee."

Lastly, covid-19 limited many activities and sports that could be played. But Pickleball can be played in a small space (mainly outdoors) and thus many people picked up this sport during that time.

    "output": "As a division in charge of urban planning for the City of Los Angeles, we are obligated to ensure that the LASER system delivers sustainable and equitable improvements for our neighborhoods, especially the socially marginalized ones. To that end, we need LASER to generate outputs that would not target racial groups \u2013 African American communities, for example \u2013 and in turn aggravate the pre-existing police harassment in those regions. Yet, there exists no possible source of data inputs for LASER to achieve such goal. The algorithm has been historically accused of racial profiling despite not using race as a predictor for criminal tendencies. However, our society is fraught with deep-rooted racism such that data points themselves bear the mark of discriminatory ideology and practices. For instance, gang membership as a predictor in LASER essentially serves as a proxy for race. Gangs in African American communities arose as a result of economic deprivation, resource insufficiency, as well as police harassment \u2013 phenomena with roots that can be  easily traced back to age-old racial segregation. Similarly, criminal records hold the vestiges of the New Jim Crow. Therefore, using gang activity and past arrests as predictors in the LASER system only generate outputs with heavy racial connotations, which in turn reinforce and reify historical biases.\n\nNotwithstanding the problematic algorithm, we do not need to cast away the system entirely. When LASER points to places of deep-rooted discrimination and deprivation, we should mend but not aggravate. Instead of composing chronic offender bulletins, we can treat the LASER outputs as agenda for our next social welfare and infrastructure construction projects \u2013 where do we need to build more schools and hospitals? Where should the money go to create more job opportunities? Where do we need to address the problem of police misconduct and rebuild the relationship between people and law enforcement? If we cannot fix a \u201cbias in, bias out\u201d algorithm, we can at least attend to the information it has generated and figure out where the biases have wreaked havoc and taken a heavy toll. We can then redistribute resources and fundings accordingly so that the historically deprived neighborhoods have the chance to flourish. In doing so, we can achieve both sustainability and equity. We can expect the crime rates to go down when the neighborhood achieves economic growth and employment, and such crime reduction is sustainable, unlike the original LASER system that continues to discriminate and deprive."

    "output": "William Jefferson Clinton (n\u00e9 Blythe III; born August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. He previously served as governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992, and as attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton became known as a New Democrat, as many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of Hillary Clinton, who was a U.S. senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nClinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University. He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, and later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive tenures as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, he became the third-youngest president of the United States and the first president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation.\n\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected in 1996, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second full term. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nClinton's second term was dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which began in 1996, when he had a sexual relationship with 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky, an intern at the White House. In January 1998, news of the affair made tabloid headlines. This scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president\u2014the first since Andrew Johnson\u2014to be impeached. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around him using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and lying under oath. In 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate. He was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, which was necessary to meet the two-thirds conviction threshold prescribed by Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nClinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president in the modern era, alongside Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton and George W. Bush formed the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns."

However, at least in the beginning, your income will likely not come in a steady manner, and you may even be investing more into getting set up than you may be earning in return. The work happens in a freelance manner - if you like setting your own schedule this could appeal to you, but the flip side would be that your work bleeds more into your weekends and evenings. Some people also would love the idea of pursuing their hobbies and interest full time, but when they have to treat it as their job, soon become disenchanted. \n\nIn summary, your decision to become an influencer should be based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and personal working style and interests."

The women\u2019s field is 120 yards long and 70 yards wide, compared to the men\u2019s field, which is slightly smaller at 110 yards long and 60 yards wide.  Lastly, men play with 9 field players whereas women play with 11."

    "instruction": "Describe a plan to progressively ski harder trails. Recommend a ski resort in Tahoe including trails that I can use to follow the plan.",
    "output": "Skiing is a fun sport with something for every age and skill level. The measure of \"hard\" in skiing may be subjective but as a general rule of thumb, trails become harder as the steepness or pitch increases, number and type of obstacles increase, the trail is bumpier or is narrower. Changes along these dimensions present new challenges and require a broader array of skills. \n\nA good way to progress along trails is to pick a trail that presents a challenge in one or two dimensions of \"hard\" to learn or refine skills. As you progress, you can increase the challenges along different dimensions. Labelling at ski resorts help with these choices. Trails are generally classified into bunny (easiest or learning greens), green (circle), blue (square), black (diamond) and double black (two diamonds). When you are learning skiing, it's best to get reasonably confident at a color before moving on to the next one. You don't have to be perfect but you have to feel safe as you progress. While colors are broadly useful, they can still be inexact as measures of hardness. Further, your strengths and weaknesses will also play a part in determining how hard a trail is for you personally. Staff at ski resorts can point you to good trails based on your personal comfort. Remember to always ski with a friend !\n\nFor following this plan, you should consider Kirkwood Ski Resort near South Lake Tahoe. Kirkwood has a reputation for some great advanced skiing trails but it presents many good trails for progressive improvement. If this is your first time skiing, a lesson is strongly recommended to learn the basics of keeping yourselves and those around you safe ! \n\nYou can start on the Timber Creek Area where there are a few bunny trails that are perfect for beginners. Funny bunny and School Run offer plenty of gentle practice for a new skier and when you are ready, ski Graduation (cue confetti). Squirrel Ridge and Snowkirk (on the Mountain Village side) are good next steps because they are long gentle greens.\n\nOnce you are feeling confident, Free 'N' Easy and Hole 'N' Wall offer a gentle introduction to blues. Blues at Kirkwood cater to a wide range of skills. The areas around Lower Zachary and Flying Carpet are good next challenges. If you are feeling good on those blues, try the backside with the appropriately named \"Happiness Is\"\n\nIf you've really got it down, it's time to try some black diamonds. Groomed blacks are easier to ski and fresh snow lowers the challenge further. Try Zachary and the trails around it. At this level, each black may offer a different kind of challenge. Hully Gully may have bumps and Lower Olympic is a nice introduction to a bowl.  There are many to choose from !\n\nThe final challenges are the double blacks and the The Wall is well known favorite. There are no dearth of double blacks and off piste trails at Kirkwood for those that have progressed beyond the labelling.\n\nHave fun and stay safe !"

    "output": "The Indianapolis 500, formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis. The event is traditionally held over Memorial Day weekend, usually the last weekend of May. It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series, the top level of American open-wheel car racing, a formula colloquially known as \"Indy car racing\". The track itself is nicknamed the \"Brickyard\", as the racing surface was paved in brick in the fall of 1909. One yard of brick remains exposed at the start/finish line. The event, billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing, is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Monaco Grand Prix, with which it typically shares a date.\n\nThe inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011, and the 100th running was held in 2016. The event was put on hiatus twice, from 1917 to 1918 due to World War I and from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II. In two different periods, the race was part of FIA World Championships; between 1925 and 1928, the World Manufacturers' Championship and between 1950 and 1960, the World Drivers' Championship.\n\nMarcus Ericsson is the current champion. The most successful drivers are A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr., Rick Mears and H\u00e9lio Castroneves, each of whom has won the race four times. The active driver with the most victories is H\u00e9lio Castroneves. Rick Mears holds the record for most career pole positions with six. The most successful car owner is Roger Penske, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Team Penske, which has 18 total wins and 18 poles. Penske also has five wins at the IndyCar Grand Prix, held on the combined road course.\n\nThe event is steeped in tradition, in pre-race ceremonies, post-race celebrations, and race procedure. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the 33-car field lining up three-wide for the start, the annual singing of the chorus of \"Back Home Again in Indiana,\" and the victory lane bottle of milk. Also unique is that qualifying requires the driver to complete four, rather than one, timed laps. Qualifying has a separate weekend. The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent seating capacity is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000."

She is notable for a poetic translation of the Bible's Song of Songs that focuses on the dramatic action of the song, rather than its Christian allegorical interpretation.\n\nAnne Gittins was born in 1738 as the daughter of the Rev. Daniel Gittins, rector of South Stoke, near Arundel, Sussex. She was educated by her father in the classics and Hebrew. She married the Rev. Robert Bransby Francis, rector of Edgefield, near Holt, Norfolk.\n\nThough she lacked formal classical training, Anne Francis was in contact with the leading Old Testament scholars of the time: her Poetical Translation of the Song of Songs was dedicated to John Parkhurst, and other subscribers included Robert Lowth and Benjamin Kennicott. The Poetical Translation focused on what she saw as the direct dramatic action of the song, rather than its Christian allegorical interpretation. Taking a cue from Thomas Harmer, Francis distinguished the voice of an \"Egyptian Spouse\" from that of a \"Jewish Queen\": in this love triangle, Solomon's marriage to the daughter of Pharaoh being resented by an earlier wife.\n\nFrancis's translation has not received much continuing attention. Yet in the verdict of one recent commentator, Francis's \"insistence on bringing together learning and feeling, what she knew as male and female worlds, makes her Song of Songs an outstanding feminist monument.\"\n\nIn 1787, Francis changed publishers to raise her voice in response to Goethe's \"Charlotte to Werther. A Poetical Epistle\". Throughout the 1790s, she further strengthened the reactionary side of the political divide by periodically publishing work.\n\nDespite Francis's lack of formal education, she aided in efforts to adapt French and German playscripts, as did various other female writers.\n\nAnne Francis died on 7 November 1800, at the age of 62."

Some of the impacts of this format on the game of cricket are: \n\n1. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has blamed Twenty20 cricket for harming Test cricket and impairing batsmen's scoring skills and concentration.\n2. Former Australian captain Greg Chappell had similar concerns, saying that young players might play too much T20 and not fully develop their batting skills.\n3. Former England player feared that bowlers playing only Twenty20 format many not develop bowling skills fully.\n4. Former West Indies captains Clive Lloyd, Michael Holding, and Garfield Sobers criticized Twenty20 for its role in discouraging players from playing for their country's test cricket team and instead play in a Twenty20 franchise cricket elsewhere in the world to make more money.\n\nIn summary, Twenty20 format had both positive and negative effects on the overall game of cricket."

Hound especially refers to a dog with a long face and large, droopy ears. Linguists still speculate about the reversal of fortune for hound and dog. One idea suggests that the sub-breed known as dogs became so populous that dog simply became the generic term (sort of an animal equivalent of the way brand names can become so ubiquitous that they start to be used as a general term for their purpose)."

    "output": "The 1989 University of the Philippines\u2013Department of National Defense accord (UP\u2013DND accord) was a bilateral agreement between the Department of National Defense (DND) and the University of the Philippines (UP) that restricted military and police access and operations inside the university. On October 28, 1981, an agreement between then-UP student leader Sonia Soto and then-defence minister Juan Ponce Enrile, known as the Soto\u2013Enrile accord, was signed to protect students from the presence of the military and police in any of UP's campuses. On June 16, 1989, Donato Continente, a staffer of The Philippine Collegian and an alleged communist, was arrested within the premises of the university for his involvement in the killing of US Army Col. James Nicholas Rowe on April 21, 1989. Ramos signed the agreement, effectively succeeding the 1981 Soto\u2013Enrile accord. The agreement was made to ensure the academic freedom of UP's students and prevent state officials from interfering with students' protests. State officials intending to conduct an operation inside a UP campus shall give prior notification to the UP administration except in the event of pursuit or any other emergencies. UP officials shall assist law enforcers within UP premises and endeavour to strengthen its security, police, and fire-fighting capabilities without being exploited unlawfully. State officials shall not interfere with any peaceful protest conducted by the UP's constituents within the university's premises. Search and arrest warrants for students, faculty members, and employees shall be given after prior notification is sent to the UP administration. The arrest and detention of any UP student, faculty, or employee in the Philippines shall be reported immediately by the authorities in charge to the UP administration. On January 18, 2021, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and his office announced to the public the unilateral termination of the agreement citing that the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, New People's Army (NPA), both tagged as terrorist organizations by the Anti-Terrorism Council, have been recruiting members inside the university and called it a \"hindrance in providing effective security, safety, and welfare of the students, faculty, and employees of UP.\" The DND notified the termination of the agreement to UP three days earlier. The Armed Forces of the Philippines chairman of the joint chiefs Gilbert Gapay claimed that at least 18 students of the university recruited by the NPA had been killed so far in clashes with the military, according to their records. A similar agreement between the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) and the DND signed in 1990 is also being advocated for termination by Duterte Youth Representative Ducielle Cardema. President Rodrigo Duterte supported the DND's decision to abolish the agreement, according to a statement by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque. In an interview with CNN Philippines, Roque, a former UP law professor and human rights lawyer, replied to a tweet from UP professor Danilo Arao that questioned his honour and excellence, saying that he had already asked the defence secretary and the UP president to settle down. Vice President Leni Robredo, on the other hand, denounced the decision and said that the decision was meant to silence the administration's critics. On January 20, Senators Joel Villanueva, Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, and Grace Poe filed a bill in the Senate to institutionalize the accord into Republic Act No. 9005, or the University of the Philippines Charter of 2008. Several lawmakers from both branches of Congress have also expressed their concerns and disagreements with the DND's decision. UP President Danilo Concepcion said that the termination of the agreement was \"unnecessary and unwarranted\" and was made without consulting the UP administration. Meanwhile, UP Student Regent Renee Co called the decision \"one of the [government's] worst attempts at destroying the institutional safeguards that UP students have fought to put in their struggle for their democratic rights.\""

    "output": "There are several, in fact! The most famous example would be the Okavango River, which - instead of reaching the ocean - peters out into the massive Okavango Delta and evaporates, in the middle of the Kalahari Desert. Some other notable instances include the Onyx River - the longest river in Antarctica, at 32 kilometres in length - which simply flows from one lake to another. And the Omo River, which starts in the Ethiopian Highlands and ends in Lake Turkana, Kenya. But these last two flow into lakes. That\u2019s not unusual for a river, right?\nCertainly not; however, in the vast majority of cases, the river\u2019s water will meet the sea eventually, as almost all lakes are drained by other rivers which reach the ocean. Not so for these lakes. Why? Because they\u2019re in what are known as endorheic basins. In hydrology, a basin is a region in which all precipitation will drain and collect into a common outlet. There are innumerable river basins throughout the world, with dozens in the (contiguous) US alone. If you look closely at the US map, you might notice that not all these river basins enter the sea. They are endorheic basins; closed, self-contained systems where the amount of water flowing in is equal to the amount which evaporates or seeps away.\nYou can theoretically find them in any climate, but they tend to be in very dry areas - e.g. the Kalahari - as where it\u2019s rainier erosion will usually carve pathways to the ocean. They also often have mountains or glaciers blocking their way to the sea. Endorheic basins make up about 18 per cent of the world\u2019s land area - although this map doesn\u2019t show the ones in Antarctica.\nAlso note that 6 of the world\u2019s 25 largest lakes are in endorheic basins - Lakes Turkana, Balkhash, Titicaca, Issyk-kul, and Urmia, and of course the Caspian Sea - the largest lake in all the world."

    "instruction": "Analyze the economic implications of a national minimum wage.",
    "output": "The implementation of a national minimum wage has both positive and negative economic implications. \n\nOn the positive side, a national minimum wage increases the wages of lower-wage workers and reduces poverty by ensuring that workers are paid an adequate living wage. It also increases worker motivation, encourages recruitment, and reduces workplace stress. Additionally, a higher minimum wage can stimulate economic growth due to increased consumer spending. \n\nOn the negative side, the imposition of a minimum wage reduces the number of available job opportunities due to the resulting increase in labor costs. This can result in fewer people being employed and an increase in underemployment. A higher minimum wage can also be cost prohibitive for small businesses, as they may not be able to afford to hire low-skilled workers. Additionally, a minimum wage increase might lead to price increases for consumers, due to increased production costs for businesses. \n\nIn conclusion, a national minimum wage can help bolster the economy by increasing the wages of workers and encouraging economic growth. There are also potential negative economic implications, however, such as reducing job availability and increasing prices for consumers. Each country should carefully consider the implications and impacts of a national minimum wage before implementing it."

Few banks today restrict their activities to such a narrow scope.\n\nIn modern usage in the United States, the term additionally has taken on a more narrow meaning, and refers to a financial institution providing capital to companies in the form of share ownership instead of loans. A merchant bank also provides advice on corporate matters to the firms in which they invest."

The fire destroyed an estimated 17,450 buildings, leaving an estimated 100,000 people homeless and causing an estimated $200 million in damages. Despite being one of the worst disasters to ever occur in United States history, the fire helped the city rebuild and led to new building codes, including the construction of large firebreaks around the city that may have saved it from further devastation. It was an important factor in Chicago's massive population growth that made the city the second-largest in the nation by 1890."

    "output": "The Silmarillion (Quenya: [silma\u02c8rilli\u0254n]) is a collection of myths[T 1] and stories in varying styles by the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien. It was edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 1977, assisted by the fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay.[T 2] It tells of E\u00e4, a fictional universe that includes the Blessed Realm of Valinor, the once-great region of Beleriand, the sunken island of N\u00famenor, and the continent of Middle-earth, where Tolkien's most popular works\u2014The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings\u2014are set. After the success of The Hobbit, Tolkien's publisher Stanley Unwin requested a sequel, and Tolkien offered a draft of the writings that would later become The Silmarillion. Unwin rejected this proposal, calling the draft obscure and \"too Celtic\", so Tolkien began working on a new story that eventually became The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe Silmarillion has five parts. The first, Ainulindal\u00eb, tells in mythic style of the creation of E\u00e4, the \"world that is.\" The second part, Valaquenta, gives a description of the Valar and Maiar, supernatural powers of E\u00e4. The next section, Quenta Silmarillion, which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the First Age, including the wars over three jewels, the Silmarils, that gave the book its title. The fourth part, Akallab\u00eath, relates the history of the Downfall of N\u00famenor and its people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, is a brief summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings and those that led to them.\n\nThe book shows the influence of many sources, including the Finnish epic Kalevala, Greek mythology in the lost island of Atlantis (as N\u00famenor) and the Olympian gods (in the shape of the Valar, though these also resemble the Norse \u00c6sir).\n\nBecause J. R. R. Tolkien died leaving his legendarium unedited, Christopher Tolkien selected and edited materials to tell the story from start to end. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material, within the tenor of his father's thought, to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative, particularly Chapter 22, \"Of the Ruin of Doriath\".\n\nThe Silmarillion received a generally poor reception on publication. Scholars found the work problematic, not least because the book is a construction, not authorised by Tolkien himself, from the large corpus of documents and drafts also called \"The Silmarillion\". Scholars have noted that Tolkien intended the work to be a mythology, penned by many hands, and redacted by a fictional editor, whether \u00c6lfwine or Bilbo Baggins. As such, the scholar Gergely Nagy considers that the fact that the work has indeed been edited actually realises Tolkien's intention."

While CrossFit is an excellent way to get and stay in shape, it has received backlash from the media for the increased potential for injury that is also associated with the programming. Even with the media backlash, CrossFit has remained a popular syle of workout for those looking to get in shape."

There are also decaf versions which have close to no coffee. Normal brew, Espresso, Instant, French Press, Drip coffee, pour over, and cold brew all tend to vary slightly in caffeine content that ultimately make it into your cup.  In general you can expect con average 95 mg of caffeine from a normal size drip coffee. \n\nAnother example from a reputable coffee chain (Dunkin Donuts) claims the following:\namounts per size:\nSmall (10 oz): 215 mg\nMedium (16 oz): 302 mg\nLarge (20 oz): 431 mg\nExtra large (24 oz): 517 mg\n\nToo much caffeine can have health risks that one should be aware of."

    "output": "Even if the target is binary, we can still use linear regression models if the importance of the model is just predicting the ranking estimates. Let us take an example where your manager wants you to find the top 20% or 30% of your customers based on who is likely to respond for an e-mail offer. You don\u2019t need to predict who is going to respond and who is not going to respond. In this case, you need to rank order your customers with most probability of response to least probability of response and give your manager the top 20 or 30%. So in this case, y or the dependent variable is just the logit score or the ranking estimates. However, if the idea is to predict the decisions (i.e. classification of the predicted rankings into decisions) then we need the logistic regression model to calculate the prediction estimates based on the logistic function which uses the logit score. Then using an appropriate threshold value, these prediction estimates can be converted to decisions."

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the \"modern NBA\", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the \"strictly dominate\" strategy as this allows the \"modern\" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1). The Golden State Warriors championship run in the 2010s with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is a great example of this coaching and player construction strategy. Now nearly all NBA teams employ this strategy, so it is less effective (A Nash (Not Steve Nash!) Equilibrium)."

(2) I would only allow one serve - instead of two - per player when starting each point. (3) I would stop players from wasting time between points by limiting their towel breaks to 23 seconds long. (4) If a player's service hits the net and goes over, they win the point (this means no replaying of points due to hitting the netcord and flopping over the net). (5) I would declare a rally null and void if it goes over 20 shots; it would count for nothing and both players would have wasted their efforts without any positive outcome. (6) I would not allow players to take a break, between games, until 4 games had been consecutively played, regardless of their physical capabilities. (7) The maximum number of tennis sets that can be played in major Tennis tournaments be limited to three. (8) If a tennis match exceeds three hours in duration it gets called a \"tie\" - no winner, and rewards are halved."

Similarly, if you have a positive attitude towards someone, you may be more likely to notice and remember their positive behaviors.  Expectation bias can lead people to make a skewed interpretation of reality and therefore make inaccurate conclusions."

    "output": "Bearded iris are one of the most popular perennial flowers in the American landscape.  They have attractive spiky foliage that is evergreen in many Zones and provide beautiful blooms multiple times a year.  They are cold hardy and are easily propagated and transplanted.\n\nThe best time of the year to transplant bearded iris is late summer.  This provides the plant with sufficient time to establish a new root structure before the winter.  Bearded iris grow from rhizomes, which quickly grow roots that provide the plant with the nutrients required to grow and form flowers.  The rhizomes should be removed from the soil using a garden fork making an attempt to keep as much root structure as possible.  The spiky leaves of the plant can be trimmed at this time to reduce the risk of the plant being disturbed by strong wind gusts when it is replanted.  Plant the rhizome in its new location so that only about a half of the rhizome is buried in the soil.  This enables the rhizome to receive direct sunlight and more vigorously replenish its stored starches and proteins."

Unfortunately, this outing was foiled by the constant downpour of rain so Lisa resigned herself to a day inside with the tiny tyrant. Stella arrived early and excited to play.  Lisa decided to begin with a game of hide and seek, after all this could take up a good part of the morning without too much trouble.  Stella ran off to hide and Lisa sat quietly drinking coffee while calling out to the little girl, pretending to seek. Eventually she set off to find the little girl but soon she realized that something was wrong.  No matter where she looked, Stella was nowhere to be found. The house wasn't that large, making her disappearance even more perplexing.  Lisa had only recently moved into the home that she bought from her great aunt shortly before her death and she hasn't even moved out all of the existing furniture. Maybe Stella had gotten stuck somewhere behind the large wardrobe in the bedroom or she had climbed up into a cupboard in the laundry room.  Panic was starting to settle in as she moved the wardrobe further from the wall, where only a small child could have hidden before.  Suddenly, saw a small crack in the wall, and then realized it was a small door that she never knew was there.  The door was slightly ajar and she eventually moved the wardrobe enough to open the door and climb inside. What was this place?  The entrance opened up to reveal a small room that Lisa never knew existed!  It was full of treasure, gold bars and jewels.  Stella sat in the middle of the room quietly playing with the treasure, unaware of the immense value she was surrounded by.  Lisa had known her aunt was a secretive woman but this was an incredible find and would change her life forever.  Stella's visit was the good luck charm she needed to unlock this bounty and she would be forever grateful to the little girl!  Time to call her brother-in-law to thank him for letting Stella visit."

    "instruction": "Should superheroes be allowed to break the law?",
    "output": "In Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s essay \u201cThe Conservative,\u201d he claims that the law doesn\u2019t affect heroes because they will do what is right no matter what. While the term hero is subjective, as not all people who break the laws are heroes, Emerson is correct to argue that to be truly just and great sometimes requires breaking the law.\n\tA common example of greatness is superheroes; their extraordinary physical abilities put to use to save the world from evil. However, their greatness sometimes conflicts with the law. For example, in Spiderman, Peter Parker choses to keep his identity a secret, to protect himself not only from paparatzi like J. Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons), but also from police. Though Spiderman is a hero at heart, he commits murder, puts people in harms way, and destroys buildings and public spaces. However, because he is a hero, he is able to \u201coutshine\u201d the law in order to continue to help and save the people of New York.\n\tAnother example of sacraficial heroism is playing defensive soccer, only is this case the laws are the rules and breaking them is just a foul. A good defender knows that when their defense is outnumbered by the opposing attackers, their defense is out of position, or their goalie is out of position, you have to commit a foul. Though the foul gives the other team an opportunity to set up a potential scoring play, the sacrifice must be made in order for the defense to recollect and reorganize, allowing them to be better prepared for the attack. Though this form of heroism isn\u2019t as grand as Spiderman, breaking the \u201claws\u201d of the game is still very important and generally considered to be the smarter play.\n\tThough Emerson\u2019s point is generally true, there are some faults, the most important one being that not everyone who breaks the law is considered to be a hero to everyone. Though this struggle can also be seen is Spiderman, a much better example is our former president, Donald Trump. Former President Trump has escaped paying taxes, began violent riots, and has even been impeached for using his position to attempt to take down a political rival (President Biden). In many Americans eyes, Donald Trump is not a hero but a villan who gained power by uniting his followers with rage, creating a cult of angry conservatives who follow his every order. However, to those who do support him, Trump is a hero who saved the USA from \u201ccrazy liberals\u201d like Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton. There are hundreds of thousands of people who break the law who aren\u2019t heroes, like Donald Trump.\n\tOn the contrary, in some cases, sometimes being a hero requires breaking the law in order to achieve equality. On of the greatest examples of law-breaking heroes is Gandhi, the Indian nationalist whose goal was achieving India\u2019s independence from the British. Gandhi, though he is considered to be one of the most respected role models for peace, was imprisoned 11 times for breaking British laws in India. He used his imprisonments to unite Indians to rise against the British government with non-violent protesting. Gandhi encouraged people to break the law in order to expose the horrible violence that the British inflicted on India. Gandhi was and is a hero to many and yet he broke the law hundreds of times.\n\tBeing a true hero takes guts, compassion, and sacrifice, all of which support Emerson\u2019s idea that true heroes don\u2019t need to follow the law. Laws are created as a social contract, an idea which came from enlightenment philosophe Jean-Jaques Rousseau, who believed that the social contract bound our society together and kept people in check based on the morals and values of the community. The purpose of laws is to create equality for large amounts of people, an equality that stops people from doing whatever they want that could potentially disrupt society. \nHowever, humans are imperfect and because of that humans can create imperfect laws. One rule that Gandhi fought against was that Indians couldn\u2019t make their own salt from the ocean, they had to purchase it from the British, who had plainly taken the salt from India, sent it back to England to be processed, and then shipped it back to India to make a profit. Gandhi argued why must Indians buy british salt when we can make our own Indian salt right here? This law was clearly ridiculous: why should Indians have to buy British salt? \nIt is because of imperfect laws that heroes, like Gandhi, should break the law and make their own salt. Sometimes breaking the law allows Spiderman to save the city from the Green Goblin, or allows the defense to organize and defeat their oposing attackers, or allows Gandhi to free India from the violent control of the British Empire. Yes not all who break the law are good, but heroes who break the law outshine the law in order to create more good and improve the world we live in."

    "output": "Formula One cars are one of the fastest racing cars in the world reaching speeds as high as 240 mph.\n\nThere are many aspects that make formula one cars fast, below are the top few\n\n1. Engine:  F1 cars have extremely powerful engines that can generate around 1000 bhp at up to 20,000 rpm\n2. Power-to-Weight ratio: F1 cars are also extremely light at around 800 kgs giving them a power-to-weight ratio of 12000-1400 hp/ton. For comparison, the best Porsche cars have a power-to-weight ratio of only 300-400 hp/ton.\n2. Aerodynamics: F1 cars are fitted with extremely sophisticated aerodynamics including a rear wing, front wing and body parts that help reduce aerodynamic drag for straight-line speeds while adding downforce to help around corners\n3. Tires: F1 tires are extremely large and sticky. This help the cars stick to the road as the car goes through turns very fast.\n4. Brakes: Lastly F1 brakes are very powerful and can slow down a car extremely quickly. This allows F1 cars to be at top speed for much longer before needing to slow down for taking a turn."

    "output": "- The risk, return, and correlation measures used by Modern portfolio theory (MPT) are based on\u00a0expected values, such expected values fail to take account of new circumstances that did not exist when the historical data were generated\n- The risk measurements used in MPT are\u00a0probabilistic because MPT models risk in terms of the likelihood of losses based on past market data and not why the losses occur.\n- MPT attempts to minimize risks in the form of variance. However, this metric doesn\u2019t reflect investors\u2019 true concerns in practice. Variance is symmetric, so it punishes high returns the same way as high losses. However, investors care more about loss than gain, so the perception of risk is asymmetric in nature. Coherent risk measures should be a better metric that reflects investors\u2019 preference\n- MPT assumes that returns follow Gaussian distribution. However, many scholars suggest that returns might follow other distributions such as stable distributions\n- MPT relies on the efficient-market hypothesis and assumes that share price fluctuation is a risk measure. However, building a portfolio based on historical volatility is a questionable premise criticized by Sir John Templeton"

There are numerous reasons why being childfree is trending. The decision to have a child comes with responsibilities and many couples do not want to embrace it. Some couples avoid the idea of having children based on past experience in the family or simply because not having a child opens new avenues to explore and spend time doing other meaningful things in life. Unwillingness to bear the financial burden of raising a child is another reason why some couples avoid the idea.\n\nNevertheless, the trend represents the rise in deterioration of interpersonal relationships. It prevents overpopulation and indirectly impacts events like recession, inflation, global warming etc. and in a consumer centric world the resonance of this trend cannot be ignored in the global economy."

    "output": "An important general difference in the focus and purpose between machine learning and the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is that machine learning is more oriented towards applications than explaining the basic nature of the underlying phenomena. Machine Learning is relatively less concerned with identifying the specific relations between the involved variables. For example, uncovering the nature of the underlying functions or the specific types of interactive, multivariate dependencies between variables are not the main goal of machine learning. Instead, the focus is on producing a solution that can generate useful predictions. Machine Learning accepts among others a \"black box\" type approach to data exploration or knowledge discovery and uses not only the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, but also such techniques as Neural Networks which can generate valid predictions but are not capable of identifying the specific nature of the interrelations between the variables on which the predictions are based."

The kids can swim and splash while the parents visit together on the deck.  Food, drink and birthday cake are essential to the fun!  Just be thoughtful about keeping the eating and swimming as two distinct activities during the party.\n2. Pizza making party - This is great for the kids and the parents alike.  You can get fresh pizza dough from most any grocery store.  Have bowls of sauce, mozzarella cheese, meats, and vegetables that each member of the party can choose the ingredients they want on their pizza. Let each person make their own.  Have the oven hot and ready to cook the pizzas as your guests prepare their own special concoction.  While people are waiting, you can do things like have games, have a sing-a-long, or just visit.\n3. Outdoor organized games - Pick four or five organized games and have some of the adults be the facilitators.  Divide the attendees into teams, mix the teams up and just make sure everyone is being included.  After the games, or at a halfway mark, break for food and cake!\n\nThese are just a few ideas.  Let your imagination run freely.  Anything that creates fun, includes everyone, makes the birthday boy feel loved and includes food, you'll have a winning celebration!"

The food and beverage scene is also quite compelling, with classics like red beans and rice, fried chicken, delicious seafood, and beignets. Two weekends in the spring combine the music and the food in a giant festival called Jazz Fest, with many stages and vendors spread out for an open-air celebration of the best the city has to offer. There are also comprehensive culture and history museums, including the famous World War 2 museum, because the boats used to storm the beaches at Normandy were inspired by watercraft common to Louisiana."

Despite this, many believe that we are still able to make choices that are based on our own free will. \n\nOne argument suggests that free will does exist, as our actions are a product of what we choose to do with the limited set of information available to us. As individuals, we still have the right to make decisions and act according to what we know, even if a deterministic system exists. Alternatively, others argue that while we are part of a universal system, the choices we make are based on the lens of our unique perspective and the biases that come with it. Ultimately, the answer to this debate largely depends on individual beliefs."

Many young people prefer to eat at night so that they can enjoy the company of friends and a drink at night. Typically, only elderly people and small children eat dinner at an earlier time. I prefer to eat dinner early because most of the best restaurants have open reservations at 5:00 pm, so I can almost always get a good table. I'm not particularly eager to eat late in the evening because then I have a hard time sleeping at night. I prefer to have dinner at 5:00 pm because it starts the evening earlier, forces you to leave work and allows you to spend the whole evening with your friends and family. It leaves space for the evening to unfold."

I think the most important thing about being a parent to a three year old is loving them, but the tricky part is how you let that love manifest. Kids are super sensitive and still learning emotions at this age, so its really important to be slow, intentional and extra super patient with a three year old. \n\nAn example I have of this from my little girl, Addie, who just turned three on Sunday, is communicating what is possible vs. what is not possible in a very clear way. Last night, I told my daughter that we had a doctor's appointment in the AM for her annual check-up, but she immediately wanted to go THEN, right away to the doctor. There began the two hour downhill spin into a full tantrum because she did not understand that she could not go to the doctor that night, because they were closed.\n\nThis might seem like a disparate example of how to show you love a child, but it took every ounce of my patience, calm and rationality to keep explaining to my screaming, flailing, alligator of a child that we could not see the doctor until tomorrow. (Also, what three year old is THAT excited to see a doctor?  I don't know, its insane to me!)\n\nSo the answer is, love, but in all ways that you can manifest that love, directly and indirectly."

For example, succulent-type plants may require less frequent waterings than their green-leafy counterparts. Research your new plants' preferred sunlight, water, and humidity requirements so you can provide the best care. Second, be sure to review your newly acquired houseplant for any pests before introducing them into your home. You\u2019ll want to check the leaves for mealy bugs, spider mites, etc. and the soil for pests such as fungus gnats. If you find any of these be sure to quarantine your new plant away from your current plants and treat with a pesticide of your choosing. Many houseplant owners use neem oil to treat pests. Third, upsize or repot your plant only when it is ready. Your new plant likely will be happy for a while in its current nursery (plastic) container that it came home from the shop in. You can choose to upsize the pot once you notice signs of the plant being root bound (the roots take up a majority of the pot) such as water draining from the pot quickly and the soil not becoming saturated or the plant slows its growth of new leaves (unless its the winter season at which time plants naturally slow or stop new growth). Spring time is the best time to repot your plants."

She quickly began to pick up on the basics, amazed at how quickly her mind was able to absorb the language. She immersed herself in Spanish culture, watching movies, listening to music, and reading books. Her tutor praised her for her progress and Anna was thrilled with her progress.\n\nWith each lesson, she became more confident speaking Spanish and soon she was speaking it fluently. She was proud of how far she had come and how much she had learned. Anna's passion for the language had inspired her to keep learning, and she was now able to converse with native speakers in the language she had learned!"

You can usually find this information by consulting plant expert resources online or at your local library. Once you understand the ideal climate and nutrition for your plant, adjust the climate to best suit it, while following the ideal schedule for feeding and watering. Also, once the plant outgrows the pot it is in, it's time to move it to a bigger pot. This should keep your plant happy and healthy."

Experiences happen to you in your waking state and the mind first starts labelling things. Negative experiences are profoundly deep rooted then positive ones. All these experiences gradually defines how you react to situations that shapes your individual personality. Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.\n\nIdea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state. At the end it leaves you a with a sense of accomplishment because as a spectator you're waiting and this deliberate attempt makes the thought (referred as devil) disappear."

It is not a guarantee of antioxidants in water.  One form of antioxidants in water is free floating dissolved hydrogen.  A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP 'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water."

    "output": "context switching, which occurs when a process is paused by the cpu and another process starts running can affect performance of a computer systems for a couple of reasons. The act of switching the context is not in itself very time consuming. The real performance hit comes from the fact that different processes have different virtual memory address spaces so all the caches in the system need to be invalidated and flushed. Since there is such a huge difference in how fast a cpu can run compared to how fast instructions and data can be retrieved from main memory, these things are cached close to the cpu in onboard caches. Even a pointer to a mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses are cached so that memory access is faster. When a new process gets loaded by the cpu with a different address space and mapping of virtual to physical addresses, all of the data in the caches is invalid and needs to be flushed. This leaves the cpu with empty caches that have to be rebuilt from scratch for the new process, meaning there will be a big slowdown in retrieving instructions and data since these will now be coming from main memory, which is much slower than the cpu's cache."

Generally extroverts tend to bring people to follow them, hence extroverts are not great friends for introverts, but its generally not true completely. Introverts may need to be little extrovert to express their line which their friends should push them over."

    "output": "Boeing 737 Max \n\n \nBoeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment. The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. \n\nThe Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. \n\nMotivated blindness \n\nMotivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing\u2019s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual. Boeing management failed to overlook David ForKner\u2019s and other faults and chose to remain ignorant. \n\nIndirect blindness \n\nSimilarly, a lot is afoul with FAA. Months before the crash of 2 jets, Boeing had known about the issues and delayed the flight data submission to FAA. Despite the warnings from FAA, Boeing got away with it quickly. The indirect blindness of the FAA added insult to injury to the crisis. \n\nSlippery slope \n\nBoeing was on a slippery slope, and the downward spiral continued with David Forkner requesting FAA to remove the mentions of MCAS from the jet\u2019s instruction manual. Another test pilot, Gustavsson, claimed that David Forkner kept him out of the loop. \n \nOvervaluing outcomes \n\nOn the whole, Boeing was unaware of the looming crisis and, at every stage, was overvaluing the outcomes of getting the jet out of the production lines and getting it FAA-approved. \n\nRecommendations \n\n The managers at Boeing must implement processes that root out conflicts of interest. For example, when David Forkner captured the erratic behavior of MCAS, the stringent process to capture test data and the data must be published to a governance board to resolve any conflict of interest. \n\nSimilarly, for FAA-related transactions and interactions, the governance board must oversee whether the transactions might invite unethical behavior and take ownership of the implications. \n\nBoeing\u2019s governance board must continuously monitor for trivial ethical infractions and address them immediately. It has to examine both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d decisions for their ethical implications."

If you're just starting out then there are some excellent starter choices from most of the major brands. For example, Tama and Pearl.\nIf you're an intermediate drummer who is starting to play gigs and record, then buying a mid-range kit with solid hardware and a variety colour options & finishes could be a good match for you. \nIf you're a professional drummer who is playing many gigs, doing recording sessions etc then a reliable high end kit with a lot of range and tuning options will be a must have.

    "output": "The new deal was a success to solve the problems caused by the Great Depression because he took action quickly, he passed many acts, and he kept the moral up for the people.  Franklin Roosevelt writes \"This is no usolvable prroblem if we face it wisely and courageously.  It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war.\"  Roosevelt is saying that unlike Hoover, he was going to take action on what was happening.  Anything he will do will be treated as if it was war because it was affecting them as much as war would.  The New Deal Legislation shows that Franklin Roosevelt had a god relationship with Congress.  11 new acts were passed in 6 years while Rosevelt was in office.  This helps people get jobs, lower prices, and help people get money they deserve.  Roosevelt says \"This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.  This shows that Rosevelt knows how to lead people even in the hard time.  He knew while it was bad, everyone will look to him, so he can't seem scared and he can't kill the moral of the people.  With all of this, Roosevelt was able to lead the country away from the Great Depression and started to get them out of it."

    "output": "The United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union, popularly known as Brexit, has had far-reaching implications for the country. In the years since the referendum in 2016, many experts have predicted the economic, political, and social consequences of the decision to leave the European Union. The primary motivation for leaving was a push to restore sovereignty and to free the UK from EU regulations, such as the free movement of people and other components of the single market.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, there have already been signs of a slowdown in GDP growth since 2016 as business investment has lagged and the value of the British pound has dropped. The UK economy is projected to grow slower in the coming years than would have been the case if the country had stayed in the EU. Moreover, leaving the European Union could lead to higher prices for goods and services. Some industries, such as automotive and aerospace, could be hit particularly hard by increased tariffs, while others, such as the financial industry, may benefit from the UK\u2019s ability to set its own regulations.\n\nIn terms of politics, Brexit has had a major impact on the UK. The Conservative Party has taken a hard stance on Brexit, while the Labour Party has been more open to the idea of a softer Brexit. The decision to leave the EU has also played a role in shaping the current political landscape. In the years since the referendum, there has been an increase in support for the nationalist and anti-immigrant populists in the UK.\n\nAt the same time, Brexit has caused significant disruption in the UK's relationship with other countries. Leaving the EU has meant that the UK is no longer part of the European Council or the European Court of Justice, and there have been disagreements between the UK and the rest of the EU on a wide variety of topics, most notably trade. The UK will also no longer be part of the customs union, and future trade deals between the UK and the EU will likely be affected by the decision to leave.\n\nFinally, Brexit has created a great deal of uncertainty for UK citizens, especially those from the EU. Many EU citizens have had to deal with the changes to their legal status, and there has been concern about the future of the rights of EU citizens in the UK. The Brexit process itself has also caused a great deal of political and social upheaval, with debates and protests being held throughout the country.\n\nIn conclusion, Brexit has had a significant impact on the United Kingdom. The decision to leave the European Union has brought about economic, political, and social changes, as well as uncertainty and disruption to the lives of UK citizens. As the process continues, it is important to continue to assess the implications of the decision, both in the near and long-term, in order to make informed decisions about the future direction of the country."

Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, particularly in the Spanish language, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha Pardo; they had two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez started as a journalist and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1981), and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in the fictional village of Macondo (mainly inspired by his birthplace, Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude. He is the most-translated Spanish-language author.\n\nUpon Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's death in April 2014, Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, called him \"the greatest Colombian who ever lived.\""

    "output": "If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.\n1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).\n2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor\n3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the sensor.\nAll 3 of these functions work in tandem to ensure the correct exposure value is created based on the image and effect you are trying to create."

Typically, the short fragments (reads) result from shotgun sequencing genomic DNA, or gene transcript (ESTs).\n\nThe problem of sequence assembly can be compared to taking many copies of a book, passing each of them through a shredder with a different cutter, and piecing the text of the book back together just by looking at the shredded pieces. Besides the obvious difficulty of this task, there are some extra practical issues: the original may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may be modified during shredding to have typos. Excerpts from another book may also be added in, and some shreds may be completely unrecognizable."

    "output": "These days, multiple industries are utilising GIS (geographic information system) as an integral part of how they do business. They use GIS to store, analyse, and quantify data with geographical information to show how it relates to other components.\n\nGIS compliments every industry. And forward-thinking companies recognise that with the ability to analyse information efficiently, they can optimise their efforts, use resources more efficiently, and have an advantage in their industry.\n\nThere are many advantages that a business gains when using GIS, and it is transforming industries such as utilities, infrastructure, environment management, and others:\n\nThe industries using GIS serve some of our most fundamental needs.\nEnvironmental Agencies\n\nGIS gathers and stores critical data for environmental agencies to track and monitor habitat, wetland, and coastal shoreline erosion, identify locations where threatened species live, water sources and other natural resources. It can also help to track patterns and help predict natural disasters, glacier changes and soil erosion.\n\nAll of the environmental data gathered is essential in helping with conservation, protection and restoration efforts. Other industries can also access and utilise the data collected by researchers and conservationists.\nUtility Companies\n\nOne of the most active users of GIS is the utility sector, and they use it to help with: \n\n    Managing grids and identifying patterns in customer usage, outages and supply issues\n    Tracking and monitoring pipelines\n    Locating water pipes and cables\n    Wireless networks\n    Construction planning\n    Monitor assets and field workers\n\nGIS, with its comprehensive database, helps to maintain and monitor overhead and underground utilities, improving efficiency and effectiveness and saving time and money\nInfrastructure Companies\n\nThe planning and development of our roads, electricity, water supply lines, buildings, and society\u2019s basic framework is mapped, managed, and monitored by companies that incorporate GIS in the infrastructure industry.\n\nGIS simplifies communications, improves efficiency and effectiveness for field workers, helps to monitor assets and workers, tracks and stores customer usage and issues, improves customer/client satisfaction, and much more.\nTelecommunications\n\nGIS is widely used in the telecom sector to help monitor real-time data about current use, outages, and signal strength to help them better understand customers\u2019 patterns and needs. \n\nThe telecom companies also use GIS to help optimise their resources effectively and efficiently, mitigate problems and plan for future growth.\nRetail\n\nRetail stores depend on knowing where their customer base lives or works and how far they are willing to travel to buy goods. GIS supplies essential data to help retail companies determine location, optimise inventory and sales, and plan their marketing campaigns to reach their ideal clientele.\nGovernment\n\nGeographical information is critical for the government to make decisions based on real-time data.  Government operations are spatial, whether for emergency response and management, fires, accidents, utilities, infrastructure, etc.\nAgriculture\n\nFood is a basic need for humans and animals. The agricultural industry uses GIS to help identify usable fertile land vs non-fertile land, weather hazards such as flooding or drought, and water supply.\nDevelopment and Urban Planning\n\nPlanners and developers rely on GIS to help them factor in several components when looking to build and develop an area. For example, they use GIS to find empty lots and determine resource and infrastructure availability and needs.\n\nGIS helps plan roads, housing, schools, businesses, government spaces, and hospitals. It also stores historical data, including ageing infrastructure, monuments, wetland areas, protected habitats, and species.\n\nAnother important factor is soil mapping, identifying possible hazards such as flooding, volcanic activity or other environmental issues.\nHealthcare\n\nToday, healthcare sectors use GIS to track disease patterns, whether an outbreak, an epidemic, cancer hotspots, or people in a specific location suffering from an environmentally caused illness. \n\nGIS has a disease surveillance system that can conduct a spatial analysis to locate which area is high-risk, and the GIS software is better are validating data.\nInsurance Companies\n\nMitigating and understanding risks ahead of time is essential to insurance companies, and they use GIS to ensure they are aware of possible dangers before giving you a quote."

    "output": "ed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They are the most successful act in the history of the US Billboard charts. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest artists in history. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people."

Take 4 measurements of 2 in length and 2 in width to ensure accuracy.  Cut that square from your replacement drywall.  Shave sides with sandpaper for tight fit.  Once your replacement square fits, insert drywall screws into the sides of the drywall that will also go through the previously exposed wooden studs.  Once the new square is secure, you can layer ontop the drywall paste to let dry.  Sand the drywall paste over the seams of the square, and repeat as necessary until you have a uniform, smooth surface.  Apply paint over the entire workspace and let dry."

One of the most-watched television events ever in the United Kingdom, their 1984 Olympics performance was watched by a British television audience of more than 24 million people.The couple went on to record an even higher score at the 1984 World Championships, thirteen 6.0s and five 5.9s.\n\nThe pair turned professional following the 1984 World Championships, regaining amateur status briefly ten years later in 1994 to compete in the Olympics once again. The pair retired from competitive skating for good in 1998 when they toured one last time with their own show, Ice Adventures, before rejoining Stars on Ice for one more season. Their final routine was performed to Paul Simon's \"Still Crazy After All These Years\", a routine they had devised a few years earlier for competition. Although remaining close friends, the pair did not skate together again until they were enticed out of retirement to take part in ITV's Dancing on Ice. Their career was portrayed in the 2018 biographical film Torvill & Dean.\n\nBoth are from Nottingham, England, where the local National Ice Centre is accessed through a public area known as Bolero Square, in honour of the pair's Olympic achievements. There is also a housing estate in the Wollaton area of the city with a street named 'Torvill Drive' and another named 'Dean Close' which is located just off Torvill Drive, with many of the surrounding roads named after coaches and dances associated with the pair.

Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873. Prior to the patent, the term \"blue jeans\" had been long in use for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue-colored denim.\n\n\"Jean\" also references a (historic) type of sturdy cloth commonly made with a cotton warp and wool weft (also known as \"Virginia cloth\"). Jean cloth can be entirely cotton as well, similar to denim. Originally designed for miners, modern jeans were popularized as casual wear by Marlon Brando and James Dean in their 1950s films, particularly The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause, leading to the fabric becoming a symbol of rebellion among teenagers, especially members of the greaser subculture. From the 1960s onwards, jeans became common among various youth subcultures and subsequently young members of the general population. Nowadays, they are one of the most popular types of specialty trousers in Western culture. Historic brands include Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler."

Finally, blockchain technology has the potential to reduce transaction costs and fees, since third parties such as banking institutions are no longer needed for the validation and settlement of payments."

There were various governing arrangements provided by the AoC, but the most important was protecting the power or sovereignty of the states.  The state would not have ratified the AoC if the federal government did not guarantee the powers of the states. The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).  This legislation had the following powers: declare war, conduct \u201cforeign or commercial relations with other countries\u201d (i.e. treaties), and executive functions that would be carried out by legislative committees. It also \u201csuggested a federal court system\u201d.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.\nThough it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions. Second, a declared war or commercial treaty required the consent of at least 9 states. Even if a war was approved, there was no federal army, only state militias. Third, the federal government relied on the states for funding.  If the states didn\u2019t like legislation passed, they could simply withhold funding. Fourth, amendments to the AoC required the unanimous agreement of all thirteen states.  A realization came that these weaknesses inhibited the governing ability of the federal government.  This set the stage for dropping the AoC, which then lead to the current Constitution of the United States."

For kindling, use smaller pieces of wood, such as twigs and sticks no thicker than 1 inch in diameter (about the thickness of your thumb). Dry or well-seasoned logs will ensure a good burn. Stack the wood in a way that guarantees oxygen can easily reach your flame. Many prefer a teepee or log cabin stacking design. Now, use a heat source to create a flame or spark and apply this to your tinder. Once the tinder combusts, it should light the kindling, and the kindling should eventually ignite your logs. If all goes well, you should now be enjoying your campfire."

    "instruction": "Give me a one line summary of the story below: \n\nA long long time ago the Queen of Odisha heard that there was a master stone sculptor who made such stunning statues of the gods that people would weep from happiness at the beauty of the statues if they saw them. One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\"",
    "output": "A master sculptor in Odisha is hired by the King & Queen to build statutes of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra, on the condition that no one will disturb the master sculptor from his work, until he himself announces that his work is complete."

    "output": "Here is a proof by contradiction that the square root of 2 is irrational. First, recall that irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as p / q for integers p and q. Assume for contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational, which would mean that sqrt(2) = p / q for some integers p and q. Further assume without loss of generality that this fraction is in reduced form, meaning that p and q share no common factors. We can assume this because any integer fraction can be written in such a reduced form, so the existence of any rational representation for sqrt(2) would imply the existence of one in reduced form. Now we square both sides of the above equation, yielding\n\n2 = p^2 / q^2\n\nfor some integers p and q not sharing any common factors. Now multiply by q^2 to get\n\n2 * q^2 = p^2\n\nNote that the left hand side is even due to the factor of 2, so the right hand side p^2 is even as well. This means that p must be even as well, otherwise p^2 would not be even. So p can be written as 2 * x for some integer x. Substituting this into the above equation, we get\n\n2 * q^2 = (2 * x)^2 = 2^2 * x^2\n\nNote that both sides of the equation have a factor of 2 we can cancel. Doing this, we get\n\nq^2 = 2 * x^2\n\nBy an argument analogous to the one above, we can conclude that q is even. However this contradicts our assumption that p and q shared no common factors. Therefore our initial assumption that sqrt(2) is rational was false, which is what we set out to prove."

Venice is best to visit in the Fall, while it's still warm but after the summer hordes have left. The choice between the two depends in part on the season, but also on whether or not you prefer to be in a park in a beautiful natural setting in the case of Yosemite, or in a fascinating and beautiful old world style city in a unique environment with canals, lagoons, boats and museums in the case of Venice. In both places, it's best to be walking to see the sights. In Yosemite you can hike or bike. In Venice you can walk or take a boat ride on the canals. If possible, one should visit both. If one can only visit one of the two, the choice ultimately boils down to one between natural beauty (Yosemite) and old world culture-based beauty (Venice)."

While you are assembling the sandwich, heat a shallow pan over medium-low heat on your stovetop.\n\nStep 4. Spread some mayonnaise on the inside of each slice of bread. Sprinkle some garlic powder over the mayonnaise -- this gives a little extra flavor that one might not expect from a grilled cheese. \n\nStep 5. Layer the cheese between the slices of bread. Don't put too much cheese on it, or it will leak out of the sandwich when you cut it!\n\nStep 6. Assemble the sandwich and put a thin layer of mayo on the outside of each slice. \n\nStep 7. Lay the sandwich inside your heated pan. It should sizzle immediately. Wait two minutes and check to see if the cheese is melting. If the bread is browning too quickly, turn the heat down. When it is adequately browned on one side, use a spatula to flip it over to grill the other side.\n\nStep 8. Once your sandwich is grilled to your liking, turn off the stove and remove your sandwich from the pan. Slice diagonally and serve with a bowl of hot tomato soup. Enjoy!"

Adults measure 5.4 to 7.5 cm (2.1 to 3.0 in) and have a dark brown back with stripes that vary from copper-brown to salmon pink.\n\nThe banded bullfrog lives at low altitudes and is found in both urban and rural settings, as well as in forest habitats. They bury themselves underground during dry periods and emerge after heavy rainfall to emit calls and breed. They feed primarily on ants and termites; predators of adults and tadpoles include snakes, dragonfly larvae, and snails. When threatened, they inflate their lungs and secrete a noxious white substance. The species is prevalent in the pet trade and is a potential invasive species being introduced in Taiwan, the Philippines, Guam, Singapore, Borneo, and Sulawesi."

In the midst of this drought, the previous owners of the franchise attempted to move the team to a new city, with significant traction at various points, to both Anaheim and Seattle. It was only the passion of the fans, and the combined support from local businesses and politicians, that prevented the move. In addition to the Kings having one of the most supportive fanbases in the NBA getting their first taste of success, the Kings are also a highly enjoyable team to watch. The players are friendly and likable, and the offense is one of the most successful in NBA history. Lastly, the team also has a fun gimmick of lighting a large purple laser beam that can be seen for miles after every victory, leading to a chorus of 'Light the beam!' from the Kings fanbase in the arena at the conclusion of every win.

    "instruction": "What is the successor liability and can you give me some practical examples about it",
    "output": "In law, successor liability is liability (debt or other obligation) that is inherited by a successor entity after a corporate restructuring. Here, \u2018successor\u2019 refers to the entity that exists after the restructuring. \u2018Restructuring\u2019 refers to any action that alters the identity or character of a business entity (e.g. a merger). Successor liability is a subset of the law governing corporate liability or liability of legal persons.\n\nA legal person is any person that can do the things a human person is able to do in law \u2013 such as enter into contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and so on. Depending on the jurisdiction, entities such as corporations, other types of firm, partnerships and state-owned enterprises may be treated as legal persons, with both rights and responsibilities under law. Successor liability rules influence how these rights and responsibilities vis-a-vis others are influenced by corporate restructurings.\n\nUnder corporate law (or possibly other bodies of law, such as employment or environmental law), some countries regulate how liability passes from a \u2018predecessor\u2019 entity to a 'successor' entity in the event of such corporate restructurings as a name change, merger or acquisition, division or dissolution. Following such restructurings, successor liability rules determine whether and how the 'successor' or acquiring entity must assume some or all of the predecessor entity's liabilities. Product liability, environmental clean-up, employment law and criminal law are some of the areas in which successor liability may enter into play. Thus, it is an important component of the legal system that supports the structural change needed in dynamic business sectors while also protecting individual and societal interests.\n\nWhile a restructuring does not automatically give rise to successor liability, the following situations are often considered to be relevant when determining whether or not such liability exists: there is an explicit agreement between the parties on the assumption of some liabilities; the restructuring is considered to be a de facto merger; the restructuring results in the mere continuation of the predecessor\u2019s business; and the transaction underpinning the restructuring was fraudulent and used to escape liability.\n\nWithout successor liability, a business entity may avoid liability by reorganising itself or otherwise altering its corporate identity. A comparative law study of successor liability in the context of enforcement of laws criminalising foreign bribery shows that countries have adopted widely different approaches to successor liability in a criminal law context. In some jurisdictions, it is not clear whether successor liability exists at all, opening up the possibility that even minor business reorganisations could 'wipe the slate clean' from the standpoint of criminal law enforcement. Other countries have comprehensive statutory frameworks that address successor liability. Still others rely on established jurisprudence or other legal principles as the legal foundation for successor liability."

It was constructed for gentleman farmer Robert Murray Cheston (1849\u20131904) and his wife, the former Mary Murray (1859\u20131943). \n\nIt is the only known late-19th-century rural Anne Arundel County dwelling definitively associated with a specific architectural firm. The plans were prepared by the Roanoke, Virginia based architectural firm of Noland and de Saussure, founded by William C. Noland. The home reflects both the Colonial Revival and Queen Anne styles.\n\nThe house on the 332 acre Richland farm was built in 1893. In the 1950s, the Cheston family subdivided the property and sold the house with approximately 58 acres to the Talliaferro family, and sold the remaining acreage to the Catterton family. The Talliaferro family named their new parcel \"Thanksgiving Farm\". In 1996, the Heimbuch family purchased Thanksgiving Farm from the Talliaferro family, began planting vineyards1998, completed a restoration of the house in 2004, and opened a winery on the property in 2006.\n\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007."

    "instruction": "Please give me a list of qualities that make the Masters is golf's top tournament unique?",
    "output": "As with the other majors, winning the Masters gives a golfer several privileges which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years.\n\nBecause the tournament was established by an amateur champion, Bobby Jones, the Masters has a tradition of honoring amateur golf. It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current U.S. Amateur champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is 1,200 square feet (110 m2) with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\nThe total prize money for the 2021 Masters Tournament was $11,500,000, with $2,070,000 going to the winner. In the inaugural year of 1934, the winner Horton Smith received $1,500 out of a $5,000 purse. After Nicklaus's first win in 1963, he received $20,000, while after his final victory in 1986 he won $144,000. In recent years the purse has grown quickly. Between 2001 and 2014, the winner's share grew by $612,000, and the purse grew by $3,400,000.\n\nGreen jacket\nIn addition to a cash prize, the winner of the tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949 and informally awarded to the champions from the years prior. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. Sam Snead was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket); Seve Ballesteros who, in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and Henry Picard, whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, where he was the club professional for many years.\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself. When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.\n\nThere are several awards presented to players who perform exceptional feats during the tournament. The player who has the daily lowest score receives a crystal vase, while players who score a hole-in-one or a double eagle win a large crystal bowl. For each eagle a player makes, they receive a pair of crystal goblets."

    "output": "Because the Earth's atmosphere scatters the light of the sun, and blue light scatters more readily than other colors in the spectrum, we tend to see the sky as blue.\n\nLight can be affected by the medium it passes through. For example, a prism separates white light into a spectrum of colors, and a mirror reflects the light entirely. When it passes through the atmosphere, light gets scattered. If unimpeded, the light of the sun is white.\n\nBlue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors of light, and it scatters more easily. It is this scattering which makes it perceptible to the human eye.When the sun starts to set, the light is passing through even more atmosphere, and yet further colors are visible (such as orange and red).\n\nYou can read more at https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/, where I researched this answer."

This is apparent when there can be ambiguity between a list and an appositive. Take the following two example statements:\n\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris and Terry.\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.\n\nThe first statement can appear to imply that we went to dinner with two people whose names are Chris and Terry who are both our coaches. There is no such implication that can be extracted from the second statement. The second statement implies we went to dinner with at least 4 people: Chris, Terry, and at least two coaches. This type of ambiguity is what proponents of the Oxford comma latch onto in its defense.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of the Oxford comma claim it should be avoided in favor of rewording sentences when necessary. The sentence:\n\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.\n\nCan easily be reworded as:\n\nWe went to dinner with Chris and Terry, as well as our coaches.\n\nThe \"as well as\" language is claimed to be more clear than the Oxford comma albeit less concise.

    "output": "While wiring an outlet can be a fairly simple task when following all safety precautions, if you are unsure about anything or have a complicated scenario, it is best to consult a licensed electrician that understands local electrical code and laws. \n\nTools and Materials Needed:\n\nOutlet, of appropriate amperage \nElectrical box - (Old-work type for adding an outlet to your home) \nNon-metallic (NM) cable (also known as Romex) of appropriate gauge and length\nWire connectors (twist type or lever-nut type) \nNon-Contact Voltage Detector\nWire stripper\nScrewdriver\n\nSteps If you are installing new outlet: \n\n1. Turn off the power to the circuit you'll be working on by turning off the breaker \n2. Locate a nearby junction box, and confirm there is no power running to it with the non-contact voltage detector. \n3. Once deemed safe,  remove the cover plate.\n4. Run a new length of Romex cable from the junction box to the location of the new outlet. You may need to drill holes through studs, floors, or even cut holes in the wall to achieve this. \n5. If the old outlet has connection screws that are not used, you may attach the new wire to the old outlet to run power to the new outlet. These are usually labeled \u201cload\u201d on the outlet.  Otherwise, you will need to detach existing wiring and combine wiring colors together (black to black, white, to white, etc) and use pigtails to wire run a single wire to the outlet. \n6. Follow the same steps as you would connecting wire to the new outlet found below to attach wiring to the existing outlet. \n7. At the new location, cut a hole in the wall where you want the outlet to be.\n8. Attach an electrical box (old-work type) to the wall using screws to tension the boxes tabs and secure it in place.\n\nSteps to follow for both new outlet installation and replacing existing outlets:  \n\n1. Strip the outer insulation from the cable and separate the wires.\n2. Strip about \u00bd inch of insulation from each wire (black, white, and green or bare). Depending on your house and wiring, you may have a 4th gray wire or even a red wire in place of black. The gray wire is the neutral wire that is often needed for smart devices to correctly function. If your device specifies the need for this wire, and you do not have one, please consult an electrician.  A red wire indicates the outlet is switched, and is also \u201chot\u201d like a black wire. One will commonly find these routed to lights or fans. \n3. Connect the black wire to the brass-colored screw on the outlet (designated as \u201cline\u201d) and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"hot\" wire and carries the electrical current.\n4. Connect the white wire to the silver-colored screw (designated as \u201cline\u201d) on the outlet and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"neutral\" wire and completes the circuit.\n5. Connect the green or bare wire to the green screw on the outlet and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"ground\" wire and provides a path for electricity to safely flow to the ground in case of a short circuit.\n6. Gently push the outlet into the box, making sure not to pinch any wires.\n7. Screw the outlet into the box.\n8. Install the cover plate.\n9. Turn the power back on and test the outlet to make sure it's working."

I can live my life according to my wish and do not have to follow the rules and restrictions of society. I can now live the \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d life without worrying about my future temporarily. Alas! There\u2019s also a negative side to this heaven on Earth. Now that the world's farmers have disappeared, the biodegradable food items would only last for a few days and would start to degrade if not refrigerated. All that would be left would be the canned and packed food items though these foodstuffs would also expire after a few years and eventually start to decompose. Soon the loneliness would also set into the brain. The reason was that man had evolved into a communal organism. Humans are born into an interdependent society where everyone is interdependent in their needs and wants. Without a community, the human race would probably perish. Soon, with no edible food remaining, I may also have to go out hunting for my meals like the early hunter-gatherers or to farm on the farmlands for three meals a day and would also forget about the worldly wants that the human society had created like electronic devices, automobiles, etc.\nThese devices would be of no use any more as a few months to go, the power reserves would run out of energy, and there would be no energy left to put them to good use.\nFinally, I would miss my loved ones, friends, family, etc.\nThe memories, as I predict, may start to haunt me, and they may also begin to give me nightmares.\nMemories would eventually turn to sadness, transforming into depression, but I would learn to live with it. Except for these changes, I don't think any other change will take place in my life.\nWith this, I end it here.\nYours,\n(Name)"

Essentially, someone with high EQ is very aware of how they are perceived, but just as importantly, they have an innate ability to discern others' feelings and motivations. Leaders with high EQ are interested in learning about what makes their employees tick, and they are aware that many people have completely different motivations. For example, a manager with high EQ understands that even though they may not personally be motivated primarily by receiving positive feedback, that if someone on their team becomes extremely motivated by praise for a job well done, they must make sure they are regularly delivering the kudos that employee thrives on.  In the past, there was a lot of focus on IQ, and while that can be a quality of a good manager, it is often more of the 'intangibles' of EQ and other personality traits that define an inspirational leader."

The problem is stated as follows: Imagine you are a contestant on a game show and the host shows you 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a car and behind the other two are goats. The prizes have been randomly assigned to the doors and you want to win the car. The host allows you to pick one of the doors as a first selection. Then, the host opens one of the remaining doors and reveals a goat is behind it. The host now allows you to decide if you want to switch from your selected door to the remaining unopened door. Should you switch, to maximize your probability of winning the car?\n\nMost people believe switching does not improve your probability of winning the car. However switching does increase your probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. An intuitive way to understand this problem is by first considering the initial state. At your first selection the probability that you have selected the right door is 1/3 and the probability that the car remains behind one of the two unselected doors is 2/3. Then the host reveals more information. The host reveals that one of the unselected doors does not have the car behind it. The probability that the originally unselected doors must have the car behind one of them is still 2/3, but you now know one of them specifically which does not have the car. Therefore, the remaining unopened unselected door must have a probability of 2/3 to contain the car, and your originally selected door must have a probability of 1/3. When offered the chance, you should switch to maximize your chances of winning the car."

The Little Engine is an undersized locomotive that is called upon to pull rail cars full of good things for the boys and girls that live on the other side of the mountain.

    "instruction": "How do you reverse sear a steak on the Big Green Egg?",
    "output": "How to reverse Sear? The reverse sear is one of the most popular ways to grill a steak on the Big Green Egg, and my personal favorite. The key to the Reverse Sear is to start low and slow. It is much easier to raise the temp on the BGE than lower the temp. Ideally, the dome temp for a reverse sear is 250. However, I've had good success with the temp as low as 225 and as high as 300. \n\nFill your BGE up with your favorite lump charcoal up to the fire ring , light the fire and let it burn for about 9 minutes. Stir the coals so that the lit coals mix with unlit coals for an even cook.I prefer to cook my steak without adding wood chips as I don't want to overpower the meat...but if I were going to add chips I prefer post oak. Put the plate setter in with the legs up. Close the top and open the bottom vent and top vent with the opening about the size of a quarter. With the plate setter in, give it about 30 minutes to heat up the plate setter and stabilize at 250.\n\nNow that the Egg is stabilized at 250, time to add your steaks. You can pretty much reverse sear almost any cut but I prefer a ribeye, strip, or filet. The quintessential reverse sear cut is the bone-in ribeye, aka the cowboy or Tomahawk. The reverse sear works best with thick cuts. I would say the minimum thickness for a reverse sear is about 1 and a half inch, but the thicker the better. I look for the thickest cut possible for best results. I personally prefer to season my steaks with salt and pepper. My theory is that if you just spent $50 on a prime steak, then no need to overpower the meat with fancy seasoning. I want like the steaks to speak for themselves. The key to this stage is a good leave in thermometer. You want to roast the steaks until internal temp hits 113 degrees.  No more no less. When the internal temp hits 113, remove your steak to a cutting board and tent with foil.\n\t\nAt this point you should have pulled the steak with an internal temp of 113, and it should be resting on a tented cutting board. Final step of the reverse sear is the sear. Open up the top and remove the plate setter and grates.Open the bottom vent all the way and let the oxygen in to stoke the fire. I will give the coals another stir and about 5 minutes with the top open to gas up the fire. I then replace the grate, close the top and open all vents. The dome temp should climb rapidly. For a good sear you want it at least 450, with the ideal dome temp about 500-550. At this point you need to make a choice. You can either sear directly over the coals, or you can use a cast iron skillet with a butter bath. if you are going directly over the coals, its pretty simple. Place the steaks on the grate, and sear for about 90 seconds per side. If you use a cast iron skillet, I use a 50/50 mix of salted butter and olive oil. Butter has a lower scorch point, so if your skillet gets too hot you will burn the butter. I've also had good success with Avocado or Peanut oil that has a much higher scorch point. Add some garlic and thyme, sear for 90 seconds a side and don't forget to spoon the butter over the steaks for a little extra love. Remove the steaks and let them rest for 10 minutes. This is a critical step that will ensure the juices will stay in the meat.\n\nSlice and serve."

When Netflix arrived, Blockbuster was already a mature offering with no innovation. It had 6000 stores nationwide, and the customer service could have been better, especially with late fees. Blockbuster collected customers' $800 million in late fees in 2006 alone.\n\nNetflix\u2019s mail-in-DVD service offered a lower performance for the customers as they had to pick titles on their portal pre- and wait for 2 to 3 days before they arrived in their mailbox. However, disgruntled customers from Blockbuster\u2019s late fees switched to Netflix, which was the initial trigger. At first, Netflix's beachhead audience was the dissatisfied customers from Blockbuster.\n\nNetflix is led by Reed Hastings, a visionary who made a bet on video streaming on the internet. With scarce resources spent on technology, Reed Hastings incorporated a \u201cFreedom and responsibility\u201d culture within Netflix. This propelled Netflix into the new era of winning in the subscription video streaming business model. Blockbuster meanwhile had expensive operations with 6000 stores and 25000 staff, while Netflix operated with two data centers and a few warehouses with less than 500 staff. Blockbuster eventually launched its online business. However, the 2008 financial crisis and the mounting debt they incurred for their investments in their online business was too much for the company, and they eventually filed for bankruptcy."

Recall that sqrt(2) is irrational, so If a^b = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is rational, we are done because we have found irrational a and b with a^b being a rational number. Otherwise, sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational. Let a = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a ^ b = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2, which is rational.

If the leak only happens when it is raining, then shut off the main water supply and see if the leak still happens.  If yes, then it is likely from rain.  If it has been sunny and dry for a week and you are still getting the leak, shut the water off and see if the leak stops.  If it does, then that is likely from an internal leak.  If it is in fact an internal leak, then call a reputable local plumber to have them test your pipes for pressure loss.  If it is an external leak, then wait for sunny weather.  After about a week of dry sunny weather, get a garden hose and pick a feature of your roof or external walls and spray that feature (vent pipe, window, roof juncture, etc) with a direct stream of high volume and low velocity water from the garden hose.  Wait for a few hours, and see if the leak appears.  After four hours, if no leak has appeared, then move on to the next feature.  If hosing down a specific feature does in fact cause dripping within that four hour window, then either call a roof repair company or go to your local hardware store and talk to an expert about ways to seal cracks or gaps in siding or roofing material."

The way your bathroom door never fully closes \u2014 much to the dismay of our guests \u2014 and the countless post-surfing wetsuits hanging from the never-used bath. The view from your back porch and the magical sunsets and sunrises we witnessed. \n\nWhen we were locked down to slow the spread of COVID-19, I banged on your screen door every evening at 8pm, pretending I was a percussionist, waving at my elderly neighbors and joining in the collective shouts to show our first responders gratitude. I sat outside on the small patch of grass we called your backyard and cried when the stress was too much. After all these years, my tears are likely soaked into your beige walls and carpet, which we haphazardly plastered with frames and discounted rugs from the Pottery Barn warehouse. \n\nAnd how could I forgot our downstairs neighbors, who slowly warmed to us and then loudly went through a divorce? Or our friendly landlord, who gifted us cookies and wine every holiday season, and never once increased our rent \u2014 even offering to lower it to tempt us to stay when we gave our notice?\n\nYou gave us a home and sheltered us through it all. You provided four walls within which we could blast music, fight off anxiety attacks, lazily binge tv shows, host game nights and late nights with friends, experience earthquakes and hide away from the world while still experiencing the beauty around us. \n\nFor that, I will be forever grateful."

Sake typically has an ABV of around 15%. \n\nSake is made from 4 ingredients: rice, yeast, water and Koji. First, rice is washed and then steamed. Then the rice goes into a special room where the environment is tightly controlled called the \u201cKoji Room\u201d where a special enzyme called Koji is sprinkled on the rice. The Koji converts the starch in the rice to sugar. Then, yeast and water is added to the rice in a large container to start the fermentation process of converting the sugar in alcohol. One the mixture is fermented to the right ABV, then the mixture is pressed which separates the liquid from the residue rice. Typically, the sake is the bottled and pasteurized for longer shelf life."

It was based upon the 1973 film of the same name written and directed by Michael Crichton and loosely upon its 1976 sequel, Futureworld.\n\nThe story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced Wild-West-themed amusement park populated by android \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying guests who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' setting expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful artificial intelligence named Rehoboam.\n\nNolan and Joy served as showrunners. The second, third and fourth season followed in April 2018, March 2020, and June 2022, respectively. Nolan and Joy planned a fifth and final season, and were in negotiations with HBO to produce it. However, in November 2022, it was announced that HBO had canceled the series. The series was removed from HBO Max on December 18, 2022.\n\nWestworld's debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of True Detective, in 2014. Westworld's first season is the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. The first season also received critical acclaim and was highly praised for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes and soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi. Reception of the series declined from the second season onwards, with the scripts, characterization and narrative opacity being targeted for criticism; viewership ratings also diminished throughout its run. It has received numerous accolades, winning nine Primetime Emmy Awards out of 54 nominations. Thandiwe Newton won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2018."

In case there is a  tie when you add up the scores of both games, the team that scored more away goals would advance to the next round of the competition. For example, if Team A lost the first game 2:1 playing away and won the second game with the score of 1:0 at home, the aggregate score of those two games is 2:2 (a tie), but since Team A scored 1 goal playing away and Team B scored 0 away goals, Team A would advance the next round."

These considerations will help you create a focus on the type of role, company, location, and industry that will be fulfilling to your next role.  Once you've mapped this out, then look at your network of friends, family and acquaintances that you can engage and learn from.  Exploring information from those within the target roles/companies will help you confirm your goals are being met in the new role search.  Spend time doing research about the sector and various companies that interest you.  Understand where those companies and the industry sector is headed in the future? (i.e. is it growing, stable, or shrinking?). Once you feel comfortable and knowledgeable, use networking to engage companies and hiring managers.  (Don't be afraid to send that linkedin message) As a word of warning, do not directly apply to multiple jobs in the same company as it tends to come across as desperate and with a lack of focus on specific career goals."

They also offer an abundance of other supplies that you might need to complete your project.\n2 - Spoonflower is a platform for artists/designers to get their artwork/patterns printed on various types of fabrics. The options range from basic quilting cotton to Belgian linen. This store also frequently has sales to ensure you're getting your fabric at the best price. If you're looking for a specific pattern and unique type of fabric, this is your go-to.\n3 - Fabric.com (owned by Amazon) is another great option with multiple types of fabrics at a range of price points. You also get fast and free shipping since the store operates under Amazon.\n4 - Etsy is another marketplace for unique fabrics from individual vendors across the world. The price points are more variable, but you could find something unique depending on what your project is.\nOverall, the store you shop at will depend on the nature of your project, type of fabric you're looking for, and budget. The good news is, you're bound to find what you need at one of these stores."

Ketosis is a metabolic state in which fat stores in the liver produce ketones to use as energy instead of glucose from carbohydrates. The idea here is to force the body to burn fat for energy instead of carbs, which contributes to weight loss and other healthy effects such as enhanced blood sugar and energy levels. It is worth noting that this diet requires a lifestyle that is often difficult to maintain and breaking it can lead to adverse effects. Some professionals advocate for moderation, balance and regular exercise rather than attempting to maintain ketosis."

    "output": "Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is \u201crequired\u201d to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. \n\nWhen you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you\u2019ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that\u2019s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don\u2019t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.\n\nSo, that\u2019s my answer. Learn at least as much theory as you need to know to understand the rules you want to break."

    "output": "In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time."

Tax day was initially set for March in 1913 and was eventually moved to April 15th in 1955."

    "output": "On January 6, 2021, following the defeat of U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, a mob of his supporters attacked the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. The mob sought to keep Trump in power by preventing a joint session of Congress from counting the electoral college votes to formalize the victory of President-elect Joe Biden. According to the House select committee investigating the incident, the attack was the culmination of a seven-part plan by Trump to overturn the election. Five people died either shortly before, during, or following the event: one was shot by Capitol Police, another died of a drug overdose, and three died of natural causes. Many people were injured, including 138 police officers. Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months. As of July 7, 2022, monetary damages caused by attackers exceed $2.7 million.\n\nCalled to action by Trump, thousands of his supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., on January 5 and 6 to support his false claim that the 2020 election had been \"stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats\" and to demand that Vice President Mike Pence and the Congress reject Biden's victory. Starting at noon on January 6, at a \"Save America\" rally on the Ellipse, Trump repeated false claims of election irregularities and said \"If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" In the same speech, he said \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\" During and after his speech, thousands of attendees, some armed, walked to the Capitol, and hundreds breached police perimeters as Congress was beginning the electoral vote count.\n\nMore than 2,000 rioters entered the building, many of whom occupied, vandalized, and looted; assaulted Capitol Police officers and reporters; and attempted to locate lawmakers to capture and harm. A gallows was erected west of the Capitol, and some rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" after he rejected false claims by Trump and others that the vice president could overturn the election results. Some vandalized and looted the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D\u2011CA) and other members of Congress. With building security breached, Capitol Police evacuated and locked down both chambers of Congress and several buildings in the Capitol Complex. Rioters occupied the empty Senate chamber while federal law enforcement officers defended the evacuated House floor. Pipe bombs were found at each of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters, and Molotov cocktails were discovered in a vehicle near the Capitol.\n\nTrump resisted sending the National Guard to quell the mob. Later that afternoon, in a Twitter video, he reasserted that the election was \"fraudulent\", but told his supporters to \"go home in peace\". The Capitol was clear of rioters by mid-evening, and the counting of the electoral votes resumed and was completed in the early morning hours of January 7. Pence declared President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris victorious. Pressured by his cabinet, the threat of removal, and many resignations, Trump later committed to an orderly transition of power in a televised statement.\n\nA week after the riot, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection, making him the only U.S. president to have been impeached twice. In February, after Trump had left office, the Senate voted 57\u201343 in favor of conviction; because this fell short of a two-thirds majority, requiring 67 votes, he was acquitted for a second time. The House passed a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, but it was blocked by Republicans in the Senate, so the House approved a select committee with seven Democrats and two Republicans to investigate instead. The committee held nine televised public hearings on the attack  in 2022, and later voted to subpoena Trump. By March 2022, the Justice Department's investigations had expanded to include the activities of others leading up to the attack. Ultimately, the Committee recommended Trump to DOJ to be prosecuted for obstructing an official proceeding, incitement, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and making false statements.\n\nMore than 30 members of anti-government groups, including the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and Three Percenters, were charged with conspiracy for allegedly planning their attacks on the Capitol; ten Oath Keepers and five Proud Boys were charged with seditious conspiracy, and one Oath Keeper pleaded guilty. Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes would later be convicted of seditious conspiracy. As of January 2022, at least 57 people with roles in the day's events were running for public office. Although most people charged with crimes relating to the attack had no known affiliation with far-right or extremist groups, a significant number were linked to extremist groups or conspiratorial movements. By January 2023, at least 476 individuals charged had pleaded guilty."

Getting around Paris is very easy, as it is a very walkable city and also has an efficient and relatively inexpensive public transportation system.  \n\nFor a lake vacation, Lake Como is wonderful, and in particular Bellagio, which is widely regarded as the prettiest village in Lake Como.  Getting to Bellagio is fairly easy, as it\u2019s close to Milan.  The food is reasonably priced, although it\u2019s generally northern Italian food (with limited options for other ethnic food).  Transportation around the lake is convenient with an efficient ferry service on Lake Como, although getting into the individual villages can be a bit challenging given the hills (so expect to walk!).  Many villages near Bellagio are also very quaint, and within walking distance \u2013 you\u2019ll definitely get good exercise going from village to village.\n\nFor a seaside vacation, Dubrovnik is a great choice.  It\u2019s not so convenient to get there from the United States, especially for those in the western United States since there are no direct flights.  However, it\u2019s well worth the trip.  This walled city is jaw dropping beautiful.  The people are among the friendliest in Europe.  The food is fairly inexpensive and delicious, with a lot of seafood options.

    "output": "Most people have found that traveling is a baby is much easier.  This is largely because they are not yet fully mobile and haven't learned to walk or run just yet.  Babies are considered infants under the age of 1.  Traveling with a baby or a toddler still requires a lot of \"stuff\", but babies are typically more easily entertained by everyday random objects, such as a cup, or a napkin, etc, whereas toddlers are further along in the developmental journey and need more stimulation, especially on a long journey.  Babies are also small enough to wear in a baby carrier, leaving parents hands-free to be able to juggle the copious amounts of luggage and toys needed when traveling with little ones.  Babies are typically easier to travel with on planes as they still sleep for more hours than they're typically awake.  According to many studies, the ideal age to travel with children is between 4 months to a year."

    "output": "Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Changing Our Lives Now and For the Future\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a part of our everyday life. From smartphone assistants to automated production systems, AI has already affected almost every aspect of our lives. AI developments have opened up opportunities to automate tedious tasks, making life easier and more efficient for everyone. However, despite the immense potential of AI, there are still risks of it being used inappropriately or carelessly.\n\nThe past few years have seen a huge surge in the development of AI. Driven by the need for automation, AI technology is being applied to a diverse range of industries and sectors, from manufacturing to healthcare. In the manufacturing industry, automated robots are now capable of accurately performing complex tasks at the same speed and quality as humans. In the healthcare sector, AI technology has enabled the development of an AI based medical support system capable of accurately diagnosing diseases and providing accurate medical advice.\n\nAs AI technology continues to become more sophisticated, our lives will change even more. AI assisted robots and drones will be used to assist in surgery and deliveries, while self-driving cars will become commonplace. AI-powered facial recognition systems will be used for authentication and security purposes. AI enabled virtual assistants will become ubiquitous, providing suggestions and advice on a variety of topics.\n\nWhile AI does provide a range of benefits, there are still risks associated with its use. AI algorithms can be hard to understand and can make decisions that are hard to predict. This can lead to biases, errors, and misuses of the technology. There is also the possibility of hacking or other malicious activities, as AI is increasingly being used to control physical systems.\n\nTo ensure that AI is used responsibly, public policies and regulations are necessary. Governments should mandate that AI developers and users work with ethical considerations in mind, and put in place measures to prevent the misuse of the technology. They should also encourage researchers and companies to take proactive steps to ensure that their AI technology is reliable, secure, and transparent.\n\nIn conclusion, AI is already well on its way to becoming a major part of our lives. It is essential that we ensure that the technology is used responsibly and for the benefit of everyone. By working together, we can ensure that AI changes our lives for the better, now and in the future."

This particular Tuesday morning when she was waiting for the bus, she spotted a shiny object on the sidewalk. She leaned down to pick it up and it glimmered in the sunshine. She had never seen such a brilliant treasure, it was the color of the rainbow, and when she looked closer it looked eerily similar to a dragon scale, but she couldn't believe that it was truly a dragon scale because they only existed in the stories she read. She looked around and spotted another shiny scale, like a trail of breadcrumbs leading her to the forest behind her house. She knew that her parents would want her to go to school but her curiosity got the better of her and she started to follow the trail of shiny scales to the forest. She fought her way through the forest until she came upon what looked like a cave that she was sure was not there before. She cautiously entered the cave and and instead of the cave getting darker, it was getting brighter, like a brilliant light was inside the cave. When she turned the corner in the cave, she saw the most beautiful sparkling dragon and could not believe her eyes! She slowly crept toward the dragon, who was watching her closely as she approached. She held out her hand as if to pet the dragon and the dragon sniffed her hand, then rubbed it's head on the bottom of her hand to signal that it wanted to befriend her. She giggled as the dragon purred and rubbed it's shiny body circling around her. The dragon then spoke and asked her if she had ever been to the beyond worlds. The girl shook her head, the dragon blinked her eyes and projected an image onto the cave wall to show one of the beautiful beyond worlds that was filled with dragons. The girl asked if the dragon would take her there, the dragon laughed and nodded, signaling for the girl to jump on it's back. The rush of excitement came over the girl, and she hopped on the dragons back. She held on tight as the dragon started running out of the cave, as the dragon exited the cave a portal opened and it leaped into the portal. The girl closed her eyes, not knowing what would happen next, she finally opened her eyes and gawked with amazement when they arrived in the beyond world, she could not believe what she was seeing, DRAGONS! DRAGONS EVERYWHERE! They were riding over the rainbow, playing in the waterfalls, and the universe was full of beautiful flowers towering as tall as redwood trees. The sky was purple and the world had 10 moons as she glanced up in the sky.......this was going to be a great adventure!"

They are prized for their artistry, beauty and heritage and often command high prices today through luxury brands such as Rolex, Patek Phillipe and many others.\n\nQuartz watches, by comparison, send an electrical current through a quartz crystal, which causes regular vibrations that can be used to tell the time. This is why quartz watches require a battery. They are significantly less expensive that mechanical watches, and significantly more accurate due to the regularity of the vibration in the quartz crystal. Quartz watches are also distinguished at a glance by their ticking seconds hands, whereas mechanical watches have a smooth sweeping seconds hand."

Biomedical waste includes used Rapid Antigen Tests, PCR Tests, used injections, and used masks. We have observed that people who use the test kits and masks at home, often fail to dispose them off properly. This is counter productive, as it poses the risk of aiding the virus' transmission, and can potentially be life threatening to others. Hospitals, too, produce a huge amount of waste and it is imperative they dispose it off properly following all norms. \n\nIf not scientifically handled and disposed, it could cause serious risk not just to human health, but also pose a serious threat to terrestrial and marine ecosystems.\n\nThank you for highlighting my concerns to your readership, and I request you to keep highlighting these concerns to your audience regularly via your articles."

Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition. The term \"frisbee\" is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called \"ultimate Frisbee\", though this name is still in common casual use. Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play."

This is due to their thicker fleece which makes them more suited to survive in the higher altitudes of the Andes after being pushed into the highlands of Peru with the arrival of the Spanish.\n\nSuri alpacas represent a smaller portion of the total alpaca population, around 10%. They are thought to have been more prevalent in pre-Columbian Peru since they could be kept at a lower altitude where a thicker fleece was not needed for harsh weather conditions."

    "instruction": "What is a stock in finance?",
    "output": "In finance, stock (also capital stock) consist of all the shares by which ownership of a corporation or company is divided. (Especially in American English, the word \"stocks\" is also used to refer to shares.) A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.\n\nStock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price. Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price. This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes)."

What would we do if we did find aliens? What would we do if we exhausted all methods yet still no results? What if there are things just not perceivable to human beings?

Local high school students who grew up in the area would take old single-speed bikes with coaster brakes up local fire roads and then ride them down the hills as fast as they could.  Eventually they started adding gears to the bikes so that they could pedal them up the hill as well.  The most famous trail was named Repack, because often after the races riders would have to re-pack the coaster brakes with grease because the grease would vaporize from the heat from the hard braking as they raced down the hill.  Modern bike brands like Fisher, Ritchey, Klein, Breezer, and Specialized all had their start in the Marin County foothills north of San Francisco, in the small town of Fairfax."

    "output": "Capitalism, an economic system that promotes the private generation and ownership of wealth and resources, helps promote innovations and economic growth. However, when left unchecked, it can also be a factor in economic inequality, as people are generally unequal in terms of ideas, drive/grit to push through, and access to capital resources. These provide some dis-proportional advantages of the economic wealth and resources to a few. In an ideal world, most players are expected to be considerate and mindful of equitability and balanced economic development. However, this is seldom the case, hence an approach for drawing a balance is by having government policies and laws, that protect the interest of the general citizenry and prevent bad players from taking advantage of the system. This is a very difficult problem, and a lot of countries are still struggling with this dilemma of striking a balance."

The first attention to these beautiful rock formations was broad in 1923 by Frank A. Wadleigh. Devils Garden(known as Klondike Bluffs today) got its name from a prospector from Salt Valley Alexander Ringhoffer, Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley. Landscape Arch is the longest arch in the park and the fifth longest in the world! \nIn 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, in 1925. From 1938 multiple presidents of the United States of America signed multiple proclamations to protest scenic features and permits for road constructions in order to attract tourists into the area but only in 1972 Arches National Park was officially created. \nIn 1980, vandals tried to destroy ancient petroglyphs in the park, which physicist John F. Asmus restored using laser technology for restoration. In 2016, another vandalism event happened on Frame Arch a section of rocks was carved, but thanks to technology, it was restored."

    "output": "The fall of the Roman Empire was the result of a complex series of factors, including economic decline, military overstretch, political corruption and internal divisions, and the influx of barbarian people. Over several centuries these issues eroded the power of the Roman Empire and ultimately led to its fall in the 5th century CE. In the 3rd century CE, the Roman military was weakened by civil wars and barbarian invasions, leading to economic and political instability. This instability was further weakened by increasing corruption and the growth of wealthy landowners who engaged in land-grabbing and taxation, squeezing poorer citizens and leading to growing unrest. By the 4th century CE, the Roman Empire had been divided into two halves - the Eastern Roman Empire and the Western Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire ultimately fell in 476 CE, while the Eastern Roman Empire lasted until the 15th century CE."

The items are: sunscreen, bottles of water, 20 shovels, boots, snacks, towels, sand toys, 20 shovels, a parachute, and a grand piano.",
    "output": "A day at the beach is a great way to spend time with family! Since you'll be away from the comforts of home, bringing the right items is essential to fully enjoying the day. With young children, it's important to bring water and food to keep them happy throughout the day, also having a few toys is not a bad idea. In that case, having water bottles, snacks, and sand toys would all be useful. If you're at the beach all day, it's also likely you'll swim in ocean or lay in the sand, so having towels and sunscreen at the ready is incredibly useful. \n\nOn the other hand, there are a few items that seem unnecessary, or just not helpful for a day at the beach. Why would anyone ever require 20 shovels? A shovel by itself might be helpful, but 20 is way too many, and certainly not useful. Also, if one is at the beach, then boots are likely overkill and not useful, since most beach-goers tend to be barefoot or wear sandals. Lastly, the list contains two items which are impractical for any beach trip: a parachute and a grand piano. In my entire life, I've never seen a grand piano at the beach. They're beautiful instruments, but very heavy and would take a ton of effort to get on the beach, not to mention the possible damage to the piano. A parachute is also similarly impractical. The family trip is exclusively on the ground, so bringing an item that helps people jump from planes seems entirely impractical."

    "output": "Note:  this answer contains spoilers for the end of the HBO television series, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  The end of the Game of Thrones television series was a bit divisive among viewers for a number of reasons.  First, some believed that one of the series\u2019 principal and most popular characters, Daenerys Targaryen, had been \u2013 if flawed \u2013 a protagonist throughout most of the series until the last few episodes of the final season, and her switch to a villainous persona felt rushed.  Similarly, some viewers believed that arcs for other main characters, including Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion Lannister, Brienne of Tarth, Jon Snow, and others, were adversely impacted by the quick pacing of the final season and did away with much of those characters\u2019 development over the course of many years.  Others were confused and disappointed that Bran Stark became king of the Seven Kingdoms (and ultimate winner of the titular \u201cgame of thrones\u201d), as there seemed to be little build-up or motivation for that narrative decision.  Many suspect that George R.R. Martin, author of the \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d series of novels on which the show was based, may have anticipated providing more narrative context and development for these choices in his then-unpublished final novels in the series, and that the television series simply needed to end well before Martin could complete his novels."

Next, I put a new coffee filter into my drip coffee maker. I pour the ground beans into the filter. Then, I fill the coffee maker with 6 cups of water. I start the machine, and my coffee starts brewing. A delicious aroma fills the air, and my mood starts to improve. After 5 minutes, my cup of joe is ready. I drink it and it tastes great."

Rubber-tipped pinchers means you will not need to bend or stretch too far to reach, and you will be surprised how much of a difference this makes to your community members!\n- Fishing: most fishing can be done from the banks of a river or lake, and is a great way to experience the calming effects of a body of water while still being physically active.

It dates back to the 19th century. \n\nIt works like this:\n\nA word or phrase is replaced by another word or phrase that rhymes with it. For example instead of saying the word \"face\" you would say \"boat race\". The rhyming phrase is often longer than the original word and so the rhyme gets abbreviated. In our example \"boat race\" becomes \"boat\". \n\nSo a sentence might become \"you should have seen the look on their boat\" instead of \"you should have seen the look on their face\". \n\nAnother example might be \"I'm off up the apple and pears to go to me Uncle Ned\" - \"I'm going upstairs to go to bed\"."

Find fresh  water and someway to hold it (open coconut shells / fashioned palm leave bowls etc) - DO NOT DRINK IT until you boil it first over your new  fire so you mitigate the risk of getting sick.  Before your first nightfall with secure fire and water taken care of, build yourself a  make shift shelter so you  are protected from the elements and yet  to be discovered critters.  \n\nDay two, focus your  energies  gathering food  (coconuts / seaweed / clams etc) so you keep your energy high.  Once your very basic needs are met (shelter / water / food to survive), its  time to fashion a fishing pole and a sharp spear out of bamboo so you can fish  and hunt for birds to expand your  food sources.  \n\nDay  three, focus  your energy on building yourself a more permanent shelter.   Explore the island for  wood and rock sources; along with large palm leave you  can fashion rope from.  While exploring your  new home, look for caves and / or places  where you could construct a tree fort so you can improve your protected living space.\n\nWeek 2, once your new living  quarters are secured and you have sustainable methods to care for your basic needs, climb to the highest point of the island and look for nearby islands / land and any indication of human habitation.  While searching for these indicators, assess methods of island escape to get through any surf  and start tracking wind and weather patterns daily so you can get a feel for the seasonal rotations.\n\nWeek 3 +, dedicate 3-4 hours a day to building signal fires and SOS stone messages that overheard planes may be able to detect.  It is also important  to manage your mental health and track daily changes so you keep your sanity in check  as you adjust  to the new reality.\n\nCreate a way to chronicle your experiences.  One day you  will escape your island and can sell your story to Hollywood.  Of course, if you  never do escape, you will  at  least  have the comfort of leaving something behind for eventual discovery of proof you did survive the incident that landed you on this island."

As a result, it is important to protect these valuable environments by implementing conservation measures. To gain a better understanding of the choices and strategies for protecting coral reefs, it is important to understand the ecology and structure of the environments, the threats, and the benefits that conservation provides. \n\nCoral reefs are complex and highly structured ecosystems where species interact and co-evolve. They are made of colonies of small invertebrate animals called corals that form intricate networks and canoes. In addition to being biologically and ecologically important, coral reefs provide important benefits such as food, coastal protection, and protection from extreme weather events. \n\nUnfortunately, human activities have caused significant damage to coral reefs all over the world. The most significant threats are overfishing, coastal development, water pollution and climate change. Global warming has caused coral bleaching which occurs when corals become stressed and expel the algae living inside them which can be fatal. It is also important to note that organic pollutants and sediment discharged into the water can smother and damage coral reefs.\n\nIn order to protect these valuable ecosystems, there are several key strategies that must be implemented. The most important is reducing pollution by controlling agricultural runoff and discharges, controlling coastal development to minimize sedimentation, reducing human activity on the reefs, establishing marine parks and protected areas, and increasing public awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation. Additionally, it is important to monitor changes in water temperature to prevent coral bleaching and to research and employ methods for coral reef restoration. \n\nCoral reef conservation is a pressing issue that requires urgent action from individuals, organizations, and governments. To mitigate the impacts of human activities, it is essential to implement conservation strategies now to protect these beautiful and valuable environments for generations to come."

When pulling nails, place a thin piece of wood between the hammerhead and delicate surfaces such as sheetrock to avoid damaged. Good hardware stores carry both.\n- A pair of adjustable wrenches for tightening just about anything. You\u2019ll often need a pair of\nwrenches to both hold and tighten the same fastener. A smaller 8\u201d and larger 10\u201d adjustable\nwrenches make a good combination for most tasks.\n- A utility knife and a package of quality blades. To safely cut open boxes and other packaging, as well as trim paper, fabrics, textiles, wood\u2026etc. The knife should feel secure in your hand and have a large, easy to turn knob to open the knife to change blades. Buy a package of high-quality name brand replacement blades to keep on hand.\n- An extra power receptacle for an emergency or unplanned usage. Always have an extra on\nhand\u2026you will need it.\n- Hex wrenches. Also called Allen keys. You\u2019ll need these mainly for assembling things like\nfurniture. These come in both metric and imperial standard sizes. Both are useful to have, but if you only buy one set, make it metric, as it\u2019s the most common type of fastener used to assemble furniture.\n- A stud finder. Stud finders help you locate the wall studs hidden behind the sheetrock. You\u2019ll need to know where the wall studs are in order to know which fasteners you can use.\n- A tool box or bag. The only rule here is that the bag needs to hold all of your tools. So, you should probably buy this after you\u2019ve owned and used a few of the tools listed previously, and have a better idea how you\u2019d like to store them, carry them and access them.\n- A cordless drill and impact driver set, if you can afford it. All the other tools are more important, but these two tools are incredibly useful and make many jobs go faster and more pleasantly. The drill is for drilling. The impact driver is for driving or removing screws and other common fasteners. They look similar, but they are 2 different tools, each giving the user the right kinds of power and feedback required for the job each is designed for. It pays to buy quality here, so buy the best you can afford."

    "output": "In a speech to the House in June 1848, Abraham Lincoln shared his perspective on how to execute desired change, acknowledging that charting a path to a desired outcome is not a linear path and that facts are central to the journey.\n\nA quote that reflects Lincoln's agile mindset: \"Determine that the thing can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way.\" In Agile development, we embrace the fact that we do not know very much about how to reach our goal. We \"find the way\" by communicating often, sharing facts and executing tasks that we believe will lead us to accomplishing \"the thing.\" We focus on the goal and adapt, as needed, with the facts at hand. And regarding facts, he wanted to count all the pigs and chickens...\n\nA quote that reflects Lincoln's thoughts on \"Big Data\" (collection): \"He particularly objects, as I understand him, to counting all the pigs and chickens in the land. I do not perceive much force in the objection.\" Abe understood that decisions are advised by facts and data, yet he too warned that some data may not end up being very useful. Regarding the collection of data to guide decisions: \"In that information, we shall have a stern, unbending basis of facts---a basis, in nowise subject to whim, caprice, or local interest.\""

You will know its ready when drops of water sizzle on the pan's surface.  You can use non-stick spray or butter to coat the pan first.  Carefully crack an egg in half and pour the insides slowly onto the heated pan.  Wait 1-2 minutes until you see the clear part of the egg turn mostly white and the edges look firm.  Use a turner to slide under the side of the egg and flip the egg over gently.  The other side of the egg cooks quickly.  After a minute carefully use the turner to scoop up the egg onto the plate."

    "output": "The Citizens United case is ultimately one pertaining to freedom of speech\u2014while undeniable to US citizens, the protection of free speech was previously denied to unions and corporations. Now, they can express support or criticism of political candidates. This should be good news for both dominant political parties, as liberals tending to support unions and conservatives tending to laud free enterprise both have great voice in the election process. Concern, however, has been raised that companies now have too loud a voice.\nBut, who makes up companies? Individual humans, who are free to join and leave those companies at will. Why would a group of humans be devoid of any rights to which the individuals of the group are entitled? The constitutional right to free speech, it follows, applies to groups of individuals \u2013 which companies are \u2013 and those groups should be able to leverage their earned dollars to further promote their own well-being. And the ruling has legal precedent: dating back to 1868, US corporations have enjoyed equal protection under the 14th amendment and protection against search and seizure without warrant (Totenberg, N.)\nBut the decision cannot be analyzed solely through legal theory. What have the actual impacts been since the ruling? Rather than observing unlimited spending from corporations as feared, the last ten years have reemphasized the importance of low-level donors; instead of focusing power on just one party or candidate that certain corporations back, political parties have taken turns assuming power; corporate donations remain under 10% of total political spending at the federal level. Furthermore, it seems that wealthy individuals, rather than any specific union or corporation, have been making oversized donations that dominant the budgets of super-PACs. It follows that any concerns around voices dominating the political conversation are indeed individuals, not unions or corporations as fear.\nCitizens United allows companies to further act in their best interests and raise issues pertaining to the business. US citizens can and should be trusted to consume rhetoric intellectually, instead of shielded from the arguments companies are making."

    "output": "Braising is a common cooking technique where some primary ingredient (typically a cut of tough meat) cooks for a long time under low temperature and with lots of liquid. The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process. These two reasons, namely, rendering  tough cuts of meat (which also tend to be cheaper) more tender and requiring less effort from the cook, have made braising a common cooking technique among several cultures."

His freshman album topped the Billboard charts for a long stretch of time and featured absolutely iconic and inspired tracks such as \"Jesus Walks\", \"Family Business\", and of course \"Through The Wire\", the infamous track where Kanye provided vocals following a car crash that forced his jaw to be wired shut as a result.\n\nFollowing his initial success, Kanye released banger after banger with \"Late Registration\" and his stadium album \"Graduation\". He followed on to release what many consider to be his magnum opus with \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" which received critical acclaim despite mixed reviews from popular internet music nerd Anthony Fantano.\n\nNot to be stopped, Kanye was on the track to certified Godhood, dropping \"808s and Heartbreak\", a track that laid the foundation for artists like Juice WRLD, Frank Ocean, and The Weekend to discover their own sounds. Modern R&B really does have Kanye to thank.\n\nHis discography continues with the controversial \"Yeezus\", \"The Life of Pablo\", \"Ye\", and \"Kids See Ghosts\".

Despite a decline in the quality of his recent releases with \"Jesus is King\" and \"Donda\", the insane influence Kanye has had upon the music industry and the hip hop / production scene at large can not be understated. His resume alone speaks for itself and is a jarring indictment of him being in contention for the title of GOAT.\n\nDespite heated debate and a multitude of haters, ultimately, many fans simply suffice to speak the undeniable truth \"He made Graduation\"."

Fortunately, he was assigned a mentor - Chad - who promised to teach him everything he knew.\nChad patiently guided Tim through the ins and outs of the job, sharing his knowledge and experience to help Tim become more confident in his abilities. Tim was a quick learner and soon became very good at his job. As he gained more experience, Chad slowly stepped away, allowing Tim to take on more responsibility on his own.\nDespite this increased independence, Tim still reached out to Chad when he needed help or advice. Chad continued to guide him, but only as needed, letting Tim take the lead in his own professional development.\nAs Tim was promoted to a new role, he was assigned a new mentor - Rob - who followed the same approach as Chad. Tim threw himself into the new position, soaking up everything he could learn from Rob. Another five years passed by and he became very good at his job.\nHowever, after a decade of experience, Tim found himself at a crossroads, uncertain about what to do next. Over lunch one day, he confided in Jared, a manager from another team, about his indecisiveness. Jared listened attentively and asked Tim some probing questions to help him think through his options.\nTo each of Tim's responses, Jared asked more questions, guiding him towards a clearer understanding of his own goals and desires. Tim began meeting with Jared every week for lunch, answering the questions posed to him, and finding his own answers with Jared's help. This is what a coach does - helping individuals discover their own solutions by posing the right questions.\nIn conclusion, a mentor teaches and guides someone towards expertise, while a coach helps individuals discover their own solutions and goals by asking the right questions. While the two roles may overlap in some ways, they each offer unique benefits and serve distinct purposes in helping individuals reach their full potential."

    "output": "The world's first large-scale experimental rocket program was Opel-RAK under the leadership of Fritz von Opel and Max Valier during the late 1920s leading to the first crewed rocket cars and rocket planes, which paved the way for the Nazi era V2 program and US and Soviet activities from 1950 onwards. The Opel-RAK program and the spectacular public demonstrations of ground and air vehicles drew large crowds, as well as caused global public excitement as so-called \"Rocket Rumble\" and had a large long-lasting impact on later spaceflight pioneers like Wernher von Braun. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. The early era of space exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nWith the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth\u2013Moon L1, the Moon, Earth\u2013Sun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit."

However instead of charging a fee for storing the money, banks make a profit by investing the deposits, either by lending then out to businesses that need loans or by buying safe investments like treasuries.\n\nThe problem is that these investments typically are somewhat illiquid. So if a customer suddenly asks for their deposits back, the bank can\u2019t immediately sell its investments to give it to them. To counter this, banks keep a pool of money on hand to handle day to day deposits and withdrawals.\n\nHowever, if every customer wants to withdraw their deposits at once, the bank does not have enough money to give to every customer. This is a bank run."

She had become a shadow of her former self, numb and docile. \n\nDesperate, Anna reluctantly reached out for help. She was fearful of being judged, but deep down she was seeking redemption. Through the support of those around her, Anna slowly began to piece her life back together.

They chose to name this new constant Tau.  Arithmetically, Tau = 2*Pi.\n\nThey argued that Tau produces cleaner mathematical equations throughout physics, mathematics, and statistics and, further, that it makes it easier to teach trigonometry and analytic geometry to new learners."

    "instruction": "Is it better to buy a used car compared to a new car?",
    "output": "When it comes to buying a car, there are two main options: buying a new car or buying a used car. While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, many people wonder if it is better to buy a used car compared to a new car. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of buying a used car and help you decide if it is the right choice for you.\n\nPros of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Lower Price\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of buying a used car is the lower price. Used cars are typically much cheaper than new cars, even if they are only a few years old. This is because new cars lose value quickly as soon as they are driven off the dealership lot. By buying a used car, you can often get a great deal and save thousands of dollars.\n\n2. Lower Depreciation\n\nNew cars depreciate quickly in the first few years of ownership, often losing up to 50% of their value. Used cars, on the other hand, have already gone through this initial depreciation period, so they lose value at a much slower rate. This means that if you decide to sell your used car in a few years, you may not lose as much money as you would with a new car.\n\n3. Lower Insurance Costs\n\nInsurance costs for a used car are typically lower than for a new car. This is because used cars are less expensive, so the insurance company does not have to pay out as much if the car is damaged or totaled. Additionally, if you own the car outright, you may be able to choose a lower level of insurance coverage, which can further reduce your insurance costs.\n\n4. More Options\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you have a wider range of options to choose from than if you were buying a new car. You can choose from different makes, models, and years, and you may be able to find a car with features that are no longer available on new cars. This means that you can find a car that fits your specific needs and preferences.\n\n5. No Hidden Fees\n\nWhen you buy a new car, you may be charged various fees and expenses, such as a destination fee, dealer preparation fee, and advertising fee. With a used car, you do not have to worry about these hidden fees, as they have already been paid by the previous owner.\n\nCons of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Higher Maintenance Costs\n\nUsed cars may require more maintenance and repairs than new cars, especially if they are older or have high mileage. This can result in higher maintenance costs, which can offset some of the savings you get from buying a used car.\n\n2. Higher Interest Rates\n\nIf you are financing a used car, you may have to pay a higher interest rate than if you were financing a new car. This is because lenders consider used cars to be a greater risk, as they are more likely to need repairs and maintenance.\n\n3. Limited Warranty\n\nMany used cars do not come with a warranty, or the warranty may have expired. This means that if something goes wrong with the car, you will have to pay for the repairs out of pocket. Some dealerships offer extended warranties for used cars, but these can be expensive.\n\n4. Unknown History\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you may not know the full history of the vehicle. The previous owner may not have disclosed all accidents or repairs, and there may be hidden issues that only become apparent after you have purchased the car.\n\n5. Less Advanced Features\n\nUsed cars may not have the latest technology and safety features that are available on new cars. This can be a disadvantage if you are looking for a car with advanced features, such as a backup camera or lane departure warning.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying a used car can be a great option for many people, as it offers a lower price, slower depreciation, lower insurance costs, more options, and no hidden fees. However, there are also some disadvantages to buying a used car, such as higher maintenance costs, limited warranty, unknown history, higher interest rates, and less advanced features. Ultimately, the decision to buy a used car or a new car depends on your personal preferences and budget."

Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base."

    "output": "Grasshoppers are solitary, but under certain circumstances, when food supplies become rare, they interact with other grasshoppers, changing their behaviour and becoming gregarious. Under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers dramatic changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs that later become swarms of winged adults."

As this is manual labour, automation can not help especially for customised sizes and designs.\nThe raw material used as well as expensive cloth increases the cost and requires lots of thought and aesthetic sense to make it look nice. You are paying for the quality as well as the unique custom design. \nAsian wedding clothes are normally the most expensive. Some high end brands use gold and silver threads to make the wedding day dress even more prestigious. An average wedding dress can cost from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars."

In the 18th century, it was partitioned three times by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and ceased to exist as an independent state for over a century\n\nDuring World War II, Poland was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany, resulting in the deaths of over six million Polish citizens, including three million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. Following the war, Poland became a satellite state of the Soviet Union and was occupied by Soviet forces until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.\n\nThroughout its history, Poland has also been invaded by other powers, including the Mongols, Teutonic Knights, and Ottoman Empire, among others. The country's location in central Europe, as well as its fertile land and valuable resources, have made it a target for invasion throughout history.\n\nOverall, while there is no definitive answer to which country has been the most invaded in history, Poland's history of being invaded and occupied by numerous neighboring powers makes it a strong contender for this title."

After displaying pictures of the house for EDify magazine in 2020 and recording a video tour in 2021 for Architectural Digest, the minimalist design and the poor view of the Edmonton River Valley outside became an Internet meme.\nAs a sports fan in Ontario, McDavid was a dedicated childhood fan of Mats Sundin and the Toronto Maple Leafs NHL team. He described his childhood bedroom as \"pretty embarrassing\" for its volume of Maple Leafs memorabilia. Outside of hockey, he supports the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball and threw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Blue Jays game in 2016.\nOn June 21, 2017, Electronic Arts revealed that McDavid would be the cover athlete for NHL 18, their annual installment of the NHL video game series. Additionally, McDavid's unique skating style inspired the Real Player Motion technology used in NHL 19, in which player size and other attributes affect their skating speed and power. In 2022, McDavid was one of several Canadian athletes to appear on boxes of Cheerios cereal as part of their \"Be the Cheer\" promotion, in which customers could write personalized messages to athletes competing at the Olympic Games. That same year, McDavid became the first active professional athlete to serve as a brand ambassador for sports betting company BetMGM.\n\nCale Makar\nMakar is the son of Gary Makar and Laura MacGregor. He was named after former NHL player Cale Hulse. His younger brother Taylor plays at UMass-Amherst, which Cale also attended, and was also drafted by the Avalanche in the seventh round of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. Makar's cousin Mark Logan also played collegiate hockey from 2015 to 2019 at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Tom Lysiak was his father's cousin. He is of Ukrainian descent on his father's side. Growing up, he was a fan of the hometown Calgary Flames.\n\nAuston Matthews\nMatthews comes from a family of athletes, with his father having played college baseball and with an uncle, Wes Matthews, who briefly played in the National Football League for the Miami Dolphins. His father is the chief technology officer of a manufacturing company based in New Jersey. He has two sisters: Alexandria, who is three years older, and Breyana, who is five years younger. Due to his mother's Mexican ancestry, Matthews can speak some Spanish.\n\nOff the ice, Matthews was enrolled in several online courses with the University of Nebraska Omaha. In late August 2016, he moved to Toronto and began working out with teammates Mitch Marner and Morgan Rielly. Matthews' favorite athlete growing up was Kobe Bryant, while his favorite sports movie is The Mighty Ducks. He is a fan of players Jonathan Toews and An\u017ee Kopitar due to their all around offensive and defensive game, has had his playing style compared to them. In recognition of Matthews' four-goal NHL debut, rap artist SVDVM released a song titled \"Auston Matthews\". At the 2019 NHL Awards, Matthews was named the cover athlete for EA Sports' ice hockey video game NHL 20."

    "instruction": "What are the different types of art?",
    "output": "There isn\u2019t one single agreed classification of art forms. In part, this is because there is not one single definition of art! \n\nSome people consider art a creative process that gives only aesthetic pleasure, and does not serve any utilitarian purpose. However, even with this definition, there is not a clear dividing line between art and utilitarian creative processes. For example, some people consider the literary arts to comprise poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and drama. We can clearly understand that non-fiction has a utilitarian purpose to educate and communicate, and arguably the other literary arts do too. So that definition of art as serving no utilitarian purpose is not very black-and-white. \n\nIf we consider art to be any creative endeavor that provides aesthetic pleasure, and that it might also be utilitarian, then there are many forms of art. Below is a partial listing, together with some of the ways these are commonly grouped together. \n\n\nArt form | Can be classified as\nPoetry | Literary arts, fine arts\nFiction | Literary arts\nNon-fiction | Literary arts\nDrama / theater | Performing arts, literary arts\nSculpture | Visual arts, fine arts, plastic arts\nPainting | Visual arts, fine arts\nGlassblowing | Visual arts\nCeramics | Visual arts, plastic arts\nOrigami | Visual arts, plastic arts\nWoodworking | Sculpture, plastic arts\nMusic | Performing arts, fine arts\nDance | Performing arts, fine arts\nFilm-making / cinematography | Performing arts, visual arts, media arts\nPhotography | Visual arts, media arts\nOpera | Performing arts, visual arts\nFood preparation | Culinary arts\nFood styling | Visual arts, culinary arts\nArchitecture | Fine arts\n\nThere are also subcategories of many of these art forms, for example:\nSculpture using different materials can have its own subcategory. Some people consider glassblowing or wood carving to be subcategories of sculpture.\nWoodworking has sub-specialties including engraving, furniture-making, and carving.\n  \nThere is also disagreement about including utilitarian disciplines as a form of art. Architecture is a good example of this. It is highly regulated, requires engineering skill, and provides clear useful benefits, so it doesn\u2019t meet the standard of \u201cpurely aesthetic\u201d. Still, it is common to consider architecture an art form, and most people agree that architecture can provide aesthetic pleasure.\n\nAs you can see, there isn\u2019t a single way to classify art forms, although there is consensus about some of the most common groupings."

With the help of the lever, the musician can quickly and momentarily alter the tension and occasionally the length of the strings, which alters the pitch and produces effects such as vibrato, portamento, and pitch bend.\n4. Vibrato-free instruments need different bridge and tailpiece systems."

Each person takes turns with their own pebbles and tries to knock the stack of rocks over.\n\nIf you are near moving water, you can have a \"stick boat\" race. Everyone chooses a stick and places it at one point in the river, and you cheer and goad each other to see who's stick wins the race.\n\nYou can divide into teams and create \"nature art\" like Andy Goldsworthy who assembles leaves and sticks into beautiful images.\n\nYou can simulate games like Bocce or Frisbee Golf with things you find; rocks can be bocce balls, sticks can be frisbees.\n\nYou can make a game out of anything."

    "instruction": "How do you make pizza?",
    "output": "Pizza comes in many styles. I make Neapolitan pizza, which generally requires a high hydration dough and a very high oven temperatures. The dough is made with four cups of flour, three tablespoons olive oil, a cup and a half of water, one package of yeast, a tablespoon of sugar, and a teaspoon and a half of salt. I typically activate the yeast in lukewarm water and sugar first, then mix all the ingredients in a stand mixer with a dough attachment. I'll add additional water until the dough is very wet, let it rise once in the mixing bowl, then turn the dough out on a surface coated generously with flour. Then I quarter the dough, fold a few times, and let rise again. \n\nForming the pies is the tricky part. I've found pushing the dough into a rough circle with my fingers as a first step works well, but he dough will tend to snap back. I'll pick up the small dough circle and stretch it out on top of my fists to start to break the gluten and form a larger pie with a thinner base. I use an Ooni oven pre-heated on high, but turn the heat down when I'm ready to put the pizza in. The peel needs to be generously coated with flour to get a good launch into the oven. After a few seconds, the dough on the bottom will cook enough that manipulating the pizza becomes much easier. I keep the toppings simple, mozzarella (low moisture), tomato sauce, basil. \n\nEnjoy!"

There are many different reasons that people decide to pursue getting their pilot's license including the challenge of learning a new skill, having the ability to travel by private plane for business or pleasure, sightseeing, or as a career option.  The process of learning to fly and getting your license requires several steps and usually takes about a year to complete.  The first step is to research local flight schools and potentially do a discovery flight with a flight instructor to see if you enjoy it before committing the time and money.  Should you decide to pursue it, you'll need to find and go to an Aviation Medical Examiner to get checked-out and have a student pilot and medical certificate issued.  Once you've completed that you can begin your training which will include both ground school and flight school.  The next step is to purchase the necessary books, study sufficiently and prepare to take an FAA written exam.  While you're studying, you'll begin your flight training which requires a minimum of 40 hours of flying, however most individuals end-up flying between 60 - 75 hours.  When your instructor feels you're able to demonstrate mastery of all of the required skills and are able to make sound decisions, you'll be ready to take a practical exam with either an FAA examiner or a designated examiner.   Upon successful completion of your test, you'll be issued your pilots license and be ready to take up passengers.  On average, the cost to get your pilot's license ranges from $8,000 to $12,000.  This may sound expensive, but it's worth it to have a skill that you can enjoy for a lifetime."

Under capitalism, trillions of animals are raised in horrible conditions each year to be slaughtered to satisfy human taste buds. However, even if an animal is raised in conditions better than a factory farm, killing them is purely for taste since humans do not need to eat them to survive. Vegans view this as immoral and choose to not use animal products. \n\nAdditionally, meat has a high carbon footprint compared to eating plants. Beef is a particularly bad offender. Vast swathes of the rainforest are cleared away to make room to raise cows for slaughter. Many vegans also care about the environment and avoiding animal products is a way to contribute less damage to the environment."

If a car is said to travel at 60 miles per hour, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 miles per hour to the north, its velocity has now been specified.\n\nThe big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average velocity is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average speed considers only the total distance travelled."

The project cost $2 billion, and created many secret cities and bomb-making factories, such as a laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, a nuclear reactor in Hanford, Washington, and a uranium processing plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The top scientist on the project was Robert Oppenheimer, a famous physicist. The Manhattan Project had to find solutions to two difficulties. The first difficulty is how to make the special isotopes of uranium (uranium-235) or plutonium. This process is called separation and is very slow. The United States built very big buildings with three different kinds of machine for separation. They made enough fissionable special isotopes for a few nuclear weapons. The second difficulty was how to make a bomb that will produce a big nuclear explosion every time. A weapon with a bad design can make a much smaller nuclear explosion. This is called a \"fizzle\". In July 1945, the Manhattan Project solved the two difficulties and made the first nuclear explosion. This test of a nuclear weapon was called \"Trinity\" and was a success. Manhattan Project created two nuclear bombs which were used against Japan in 1945."

Therefore, to properly quantify the statistical significance of results, contextual factors must also be considered, such as the quality of the measurements, the external evidence, and the validity of the assumptions underlying the data analysis."

    "instruction": "Describe the data pre-processing steps in a machine learning project",
    "output": "Data pre-processing is an important step in any machine learning project. It involves transforming raw datasets into ready-to-use form so that models can be trained with it. Common steps of data pre-processing include data cleaning, feature engineering, data normalization, and feature selection. Data cleaning involves identifying and addressing any errors, outliers, or missing values. Feature engineering is the process of transforming existing features to create new features that better capture the information contained in the raw data. Data normalization is used to rescale the values of certain features to a standard range which allows for more meaningful comparisons between features. In feature selection, irrelevant and redundant features are removed to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its accuracy."

To start our journey, we rented a truck and transported our bikes from LA to San Francisco. We returned the truck in San Francisco and started our journet on our bikes. Our trip took eight days and was full of adventure and unexpected twists and turns. We had to stay in motels and camp sites along the way and endure biking many uphill miles. Our meals tasted the best after a lenghty daily travel, and the most enjoyable was the deep conversations we had without interruption of phone or social media. I shared my never spoken before youth experiences growing up in Iran. He seemed delighted to be hearing my experience and taking a mental note every step of the way.\nUpon reflecting on our trip, we encountered numerous challenges. We lost our way for several miles, and to compound our predicament, our bikes broke down along the way. In addition, we were cited by the police for riding our bikes on the freeway and physically assaulted. Despite all these setbacks, we pushed ourselves to ride up to 80 miles each day.\nEven to this day, my son frequently recalls our trip and how it brought us closer together. He also acknowledges the spiritual growth that we experienced as a result of the journey.\nHe was accpeted as the only two students to Berkely and many months later I asked him what set him apart from all A's students which he then responded my colledge essay and our SF biking trip."

    "output": "The Roman Empire had many bad emperors for a variety of reasons, including:\n\nInheritance: Unlike modern democracies, the Roman Empire was an inherited monarchy, meaning that power was passed down through the family. This often led to the appointment of inexperienced or unqualified heirs to the throne.\nPolitical instability: The Roman Empire was plagued by political instability, particularly in the 3rd century AD, when there were frequent changes of leadership and power struggles between rival factions.\nAssassinations and coups: Many emperors came to power through assassination or coup, which often resulted in instability and a lack of legitimacy.\nPersonal flaws: Some emperors were simply bad rulers due to personal flaws such as greed, cruelty, or incompetence.\nExternal pressures: The Roman Empire faced a number of external pressures, including economic crises, military threats, and natural disasters. These challenges often put pressure on emperors to make unpopular decisions or take drastic measures that could harm their reputation.\nOverall, the Roman Empire was a complex and challenging political system, and the challenges of maintaining power and stability often resulted in the appointment of less-than-ideal rulers."

    "output": "There once was a small inn in San Francisco called the Crab Inn. Its proprietor was a friendly and hard-working stone crab named Joe. Joe was an inspiring leader and had a knack for managing diverse species, thus he had attracted a sizable contingent of bears and birds to work at the inn. His most valued employees were a large polar bear who served as CFO, and a brown bear from Britain who was the hotel\u2019s concierge. Additional staff members included a large brown bear who ran the shipping and receiving department, and a hen whose feathers made her an excellent housekeeper. Security was provided by a retired Canadian police bear and a retired British police bear. And because Joe recognized the importance of staying at the forefront of innovation, the inn employed a mole to research new hotel concepts. Lastly, the inn had a small polar bear on retainer as their attorney, and an Irish doctor bear to look after the medical needs of the staff and the very occasional guest who would stay at the inn. Amazingly, Joe and his CFO had convinced the staff to work in return only for housing and an occasional chocolate coin.\n\nAlthough the inn was very small, it offered guests various activities. The most popular was a whale watching cruise. Although the ship\u2019s captain, a penguin, was not a skilled navigator, guests were guaranteed whale sightings on every voyage because the whales worked for the inn. The inn\u2019s spa was focused on a small gym facility, and an emotional support bear offered counseling services so that guests could heal both their bodies and minds. The most popular guest dining spot was al fresco in the inn\u2019s award-winning garden, where a pair of geese served as bartender and wine sommelier. Lastly, guests enjoyed parties organized by the hotel\u2019s panda bear to watch broadcasts of local sports teams on the inn\u2019s large television."

    "instruction": "What is the best surface to run on?",
    "output": "Running is a great exercise, but not all running surfaces are created equal. Traditionally, those who run \"runners\" will run 5-7 days a week. Runners will average between 3 miles per run up to 20 miles per run. While running is great exercise and very efficient at burning calories, it can be hard on the body. Specifically the leg joints. The average runner will strike the surface they are running on 1,480 times per mile. So if you are running 10 miles, thats just under 15,000 foot strikes. This repetitive striking can deteriorate the body joints over time. Therefore, the type of surface a runner runs on, can have a huge impact on the body. Some surfaces are harder than others, the harder the surface, the harder on the body, legs and joints. Concrete is harder than asphalt, asphalt is harder than a dirt trail and a dirt trail is harder than a high school track surface. Example, concrete can be 30% harder surface than asphalt. Running is a great exercise and millions of people enjoy running. But if you want to run long, as in for a long time, choose your running surface for the long run. Because the surface you choose to run on, can have a direct correlation to how long your body and leg joints will last."

Also, we wanted to be clear about the firm\u2019s north star, which is improved customer experience, efficient and reliable operations with low cost, and minimal environmental impact. \n\nUber\u2019s business model: \n\nValue proposition:  \n\nUber\u2019s value prop is to offer transportation services via internet orderings from the customer. Customers order a transportation service via a mobile-enabled app and get instant or real-time updates about the order status. This significantly differs from the current taxi-cab model, where customers must hire a taxi-cab by waiting in line at the airport or taxi station. The existing taxi hire model has a poor experience for customers and comes with a high cost. \n\nActivities, resources, and capabilities: \n\nThe critical activity for Uber in this business model is to connect the passengers and drivers on a demand basis concerning a location with a computer algorithm and deliver the service over a mobile app for both drivers and passengers. \n\nUber needs computational resources and engineers to build the algorithm. Also, Uber needs to develop capabilities to attract drivers and passengers to its platform for each market, country, and city. \n\nRevenue model: \n\nIn this model, Uber customers will pay per hire, which will include the transportation charge, driver\u2019s labor fees, and the driver\u2019s car maintenance, including fuel and running and maintenance expenses of the car, and a small commission for Uber that will be the revenue for the company. On average per ride, Uber expects to earn a 3% commission for basic taxi-hire service. Top-of-the-line services like Uber-X may earn up to 10% commission. \n\nScope of the enterprise: \n\nThis business model's primary customer segment is millennials with smartphones with internet-enabled services. \n\n \n\nThis business model's horizontal scope can be vastly expanded to different products. Uber can start with a standard taxi-hire service, and for the luxury segment, it can offer Uber-X and Uber-SUV. Uber can also branch to adjacent industries like food delivery with Uber Eats and freight delivery with Uber Freight. \n\n \n\nThe business\u2019s sheer scope is to develop the in-house demand algorithm for connecting drivers and passengers. Uber does not intend to employ drivers. Instead, it will lease/contract the drivers on a per-ride basis and pay the contract cost to the drivers. In contrast, the computational and other IT infrastructure services will be leased/rented on services like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. This will enable Uber to be agile and move fast in various markets while protecting its intellectual property, the algorithm."

Most important steps that could lead to quality issues are around managing moisture while protein cooks. Especially when you use chicken. Chicken tends to release a lot of moisture and that can spoil the dish. A recommendation would be to cook all of the chicken 50% through without any seasoning in a separate pot. It'll release significant moisture in this process. Once done, you can then separate out chicken from the stock and use the chicken for Biryani. One of the other gotcha while cooking Biryani is while preparing rice. Rice should never be fully cooked before it's mixed with chicken. Remember that rice and seasoned chicken has to be cooked together for several minutes. To get best results make sure you cook rice in boiling water only 70% through. It should be bit uncooked. Then use that rice to mix with seasoned chicken and continue following the Biryani recipe from that point onwards."

His three laws of classical mechanics successfully predicted the behavior of solid bodies across all observable scales - from the motion of planets to falling apples. For over 250 years his laws were applied with greater and greater precision, always giving the correct answers.\n\nHowever, in the late 1800s physicists struggled to reconcile measurements of the speed of light with Newton's laws. This one of the observations that led to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time and matter with his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. His theories of special and general relativity changed our understanding of space and time and successfully explained the motion of light and the behavior of gravity.  His theories of quantum mechanics likewise revolutionized our understand of the sub-atomic world.\n\nIn addition to Newton and Einstein there are many other physicists who made groundbreaking discoveries,  including Galileo Galilei, James Clerk Maxwell,  Marie Curie, Neils Bohr, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Hawking."

A single person or a team of doubles will face off against another solo player or pair. They play games that add up to matches, and whoever wins 6 games in a match wins the match. Ties can lead to tiebreakers.\n\nSwimming is usually a individual sport. Swimmers compete against other swimmers. The swimmer who gets the fastest time in a heat wins. There are also relay swim events where once one swimmer completes their task, another swimmer begins. The team of swimmers time is finished once all of the swimmers have completed their swims.

Furthermore, many pet owners will also get pet insurance which can help cover any unforeseen medical issues or conditions outside of the normal vaccinations a puppy typically requires.  Recreational items are also highly encouraged.  Things like toys, treats, and collar with leash are highly recommended.  If you are aware of the upfront costs and requirements for raising a puppy, the experience will be a lot better for owners and the dog!"

When I was a kid, you couldn\u2019t take a trip without getting some butterflies on the windshield of your car. So why are there so few and what does it mean?\n\nOne of the main reasons is the use of pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are indiscriminate killers. And they knock the whole ecosystem out of balance. In my yard, I have seen how a little patience will put things back into balance. I had aphids, but slowly noticed aphid predators solving the problem. I had flies due to my chicken coop, but over a few weeks I saw Swallows and Phoebes move in to take advantage of the food source.\n\nThe other reason we see fewer butterflies is food for caterpillars. Most butterflies and moths (or butterflies of the night as I like to call them) need a particular plant to host their caterpillars. For Monarch butterflies, it is Milkweed (Asclepias), which is an unfortunate name for a beautiful plant. For Pipevine Swallowtails, it is Pipevine (Aristolochia). Without these plants, caterpillars have no source of food. And as cities and suburbs become paved over, there is no place for these once abundant plants to grow. As we look at our own yards, they contain beautiful plants that are imported from other places. But to a butterfly, our yards seem like deserts. Even plants like bottlebrush, which attract a lot of insects for nectar, provide no food for native baby insects. It\u2019s kind of like having a bar for the adults to drink at, but no food to nourish their children so they can grow to be adults too. \n\nBut Doug Tallamy, an entomologist from University of Delaware, says we can help. By putting some native plants in our yards, we can provide the food to bring back butterflies.\n\nAs we prepared to redo our garden from evergreen ornamentals, to an English cottage/cut flower garden, something happened. We saw Doug Tallamy speak on a CNPS Silicon Valley Zoom Meeting. And we realized we had to change our direction, and begin gardening with natives. \n\nAs we look at our garden, the key is that we are just beginning\u2026\nIt is a grand experiment to see what works where. And already the garden is talking to us. The blue eyed grass has jumped the paved walkway to another part of the garden! We expect more movement and magic in the future. Here are some of our thoughts on our garden.\n\nBlessings\u2026 Having a giant oak tree in our yard and creek behind us have certainly given us a leg up in terms of food and wildlife access to our yard.\n\nDownside\u2026 Lots of shade. Only two, maybe three spots in our garden that get good sun. So, we troll through Calscape looking for plants that will tolerate shade. (If you haven't met Calscape you are in for a treat. I hope you live in California though...).\n\nGoal\u2026 As Talamites, we believe in feeding the ecosystem, which starts with caterpillar farming. So how has that worked out? Well, we\u2019ve only seen one or two caterpillars so far. Sigh. It\u2019s all an experiment\u2026\n\nBiggest impact\u2026 Leaving the leaves the past year. We can already see the soil improving, and everytime we water we see lots of insects rising up out of the litter. So it is happening. Slowly\u2026\n\nSo we continue to replace non-natives with natives. Last weekend we took out Sarcococca and Pierris Japonicas and replaced them with Coffeeberry (Frangula Californica). This weekend we removed two maple trees and replaced them with Bush Anemone (Carpenteria Californica). And next weekend we are going to replace our box hedge with Coyote Brush (Baccharis pilularis). \n\nBesides the bugs, we've seen lots of other great wildlife in our yard. A new nest of baby squirrels is born in the tree every year. And this year we were surprised by 3 baby raccoons moving into the tree (it is largely hollow).\n\nThey are sweet shy and adorable. We've enjoyed watching them come out and scour the tree every night for food."

If it is a known, healthy cat, then you can approach it.  Do so with care so that you do not scare it away.\n\nThere are several techniques to make yourself more approachable.  Ideally, the cat will approach you; you will not approach the cat.\n\nMake yourself look smaller.  Crouch down, and do not look threatening or overly anxious to approach the cat.\n\nTry the \"slow blink.\"  Look at the cat and slowly close and open your eyes.  Also try looking away lazily.  If the cat respond with its own slow blink, that's a good sign.\n\nIf the cat comes near, try offering your hand down low, with the palm turned down.  Hopefully the cat will come to you and rub against the back of your hand.  If so, then you can try petting the cat more actively."

    "instruction": "What is Asperger syndrome?",
    "output": "Asperger syndrome (AS), or Asperger's, is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. The syndrome is no longer recognized as a diagnosis, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were incorporated into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.\n\nThe syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others\u2019 gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favorite interests, and were clumsy. In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that \u2019treatment\u2019 of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not an 'a disease that can be removed or cured\u2019. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, \u2019management of autism itself is chiefly about providing the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world\u2019. Only limited data support the effectiveness of particular interventions for autism. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less evident in adulthood , but social and communication difficulties usually persist."

    "output": "Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (abbr. Hong Kong SAR or HKSAR), is a city and special administrative region of China on the eastern Pearl River Delta in South China. With 7.5 million residents of various nationalities in a 1,104-square-kilometre (426 sq mi) territory, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world. Hong Kong is also a major global financial centre and one of the most developed cities in the world.\n\nHong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. British Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II; British administration resumed after the surrender of Japan. The whole territory was transferred to China in 1997. As one of China's two special administrative regions (the other being Macau), Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of \"one country, two systems\".\n\nOriginally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages, the territory has become one of the world's most significant financial centres and commercial ports. As of 2021, it is the world's ninth-largest exporter and eight-largest importer. Hong Kong has a market economy characterised by a focus on services, low taxation and free trade; its currency, the Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world. Hong Kong is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Asia, and the largest concentration of ultra high-net-worth individuals of any city in the world. Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, severe income inequality exists among the population. Most notably, housing in Hong Kong has been well-documented to experience a chronic persistent shortage; the extremely compact house sizes and the extremely high housing density are the effects of Hong Kong's housing market being the most expensive housing in the world.\n\nHong Kong is a highly developed territory and has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.952, ranking fourth in the world. The city has the largest number of skyscrapers of any city in the world, and its residents have some of the highest life expectancies in the world. The dense space has led to a highly developed transportation network with public transport rates exceeding 90%. Hong Kong is ranked 3rd in the Global Financial Centres Index."

The song otherwise tells a narrative through the eyes of a man who vows to right a number of wrongs in his relationship. Here, instead of giving his wife a present for her birthday, he vows to take some things away, such as suspicion, lonely moments, \"so-so kisses\" and doubt, replacing them with such things as faith and companionship.

    "output": "The best option for cooking a steak on the BBQ is to sear the steaks on the hottest part of the grill for a few minutes on each side, turning only once to form grill marks and then finishing the steaks on the cooler part of the grill for a few more minutes, until the desired doneness is reached. \n\nHere are the directions for the best results. You\u2019ll want to remove steaks from the refrigerator 20 minutes before grilling and let sit, covered, at room temperature. During this time, preheat your grill on high. \n\nAfter 20 minutes, you\u2019ll want to brush the steaks on both sides with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper, or your desired steak seasoning. \n\nOnce the steaks and grill are both ready, you\u2019ll place the steaks on the grill and cook until golden brown and slightly charred, which should take roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the steaks and continue to grill for an additional 4 \u2013 5 minutes for medium-rare, which has an internal temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit. For medium, you\u2019ll grill for 5 to 7 minutes or 140 degrees Fahrenheit, or 8 to 10 minutes for medium-well at 150 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nAt the desired steak temperature, you will remove and transfer the steaks to a cutting board or platter, and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving."

    "output": "The debate regarding who is the greatest NBA player of all time generally revolves around defining what criteria should be used to rank basketball players. Factors such as number of championships won, individual accolades, career statistics, longevity, and the level to which a player's level of play dominated over their contemporaries are common criteria for determining who is the greatest NBA player of all time. However, this question is complicated by others who state that comparing players across different generations is not possible, and thus the debate should be focused on who is the greatest player within a given generation.\n\nThe NBA.com website states that \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time\". Jordan's perfect record in the finals, dominance over contemporaries (many of whom did not win any championships during the years Jordan was active), and holding the highest career regular season scoring average are often used to justify his status as the greatest NBA player of all time. Other frequently mentioned greats include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and LeBron James."

The British never tested the chain, and their Naval forces remained separated in Canada and New York.  Due to its success on the western point of the river, the United States Military Academy has been commonly referred to as \"West Point,\" since the military academy became the first training institution for U.S. Army officers in 1802."

Put plainly, this means having foreknowledge of the illegality of his act and the repercussions of the crime. Intention is important in establishing guilt for a specific crime. A good example is a car accident fatality: the driver responsible would be guilty of causing the accidental death of the victim (manslaughter), but not guilty of murder -- unless it could be established that the driver at fault intended to kill the victim."

    "output": "In Ernest Hemingway\u2019s novel The Old Man and the Sea, the overarching theme of loneliness is recurrently explored throughout the story. Primarily, the protagonist, Santiago, is a representation of how constant loneliness can affect man\u2019s journey. Santiago\u2019s hardships throughout the novel demonstrate how the human condition can lose its will to live in the face of immense loneliness.\n\nThe most glaring example of loneliness felt by Santiago is seen through his steadfast companion and boat mate, a fish he initially names in admiration. Though Santiago loses his prized fish, he names the shark the \u201cMako Shark\u201d which further symbolises his own loneliness. Throughout the book, Santiago is often seen talking to himself and the fish, and even the salt water, indicating his immense loneliness and desire to communicate with something.\n\nAdditionally, Santiago often talks with the stars in the night sky, as if trying to break his loneliness through conversation. In this sense, the stars are Santiago\u2019s closest friend and provide a source of comfort to him. Even so, in spite of his constant search for companionship and comfort, Santiago is unable to recover from the immense loneliness and becomes a proverbial old man of the sea, travelling alone and seemingly in vain.\n\nEventually, through his patience and courage, Santiago is able to return to the shore, but this is not accompanied by a sense of triumph. Instead, there is a sense of inevitable death and Santiago knows that he will go to a place of solitude, presumably death in his bed, as a result of his loneliness.\n\nIn conclusion, through Santiago\u2019s explorations of loneliness, Hemingway creates a deeply moving and realistic portrait of human life and the effects of loneliness, reminding us of the power of hope and perseverance. Furthermore, it demonstrates the power of companionship, which can provide necessary comfort in the face of hardship and loneliness. Therefore, despite Santiago\u2019s struggles, he still performs his grueling journey with dignity, revealing Hemingway\u2019s thoughtful exploration of the essential role of companionship in human life."

Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as \"the most popular American rock and roll band of the '90s\".\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13\u00d7 platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.\n\nOne of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"\n\nPearl Jam had sold more than 85 million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32 million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. They were ranked eighth in a readers' poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue. Throughout its career, the band has also promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-abortion rights sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency.

I shall wait in the west and the fox can wait in the east and ensure the prey do not escape to the east or west.\n \nGood idea. so they all followed the plan. Along came a rabbit, ran helter skelter frightened  on seeing the fox and the wolf and straight into the lion, who with one swipe of its paw killed the rabbit. Next a donkey came by and met a similar fate. So did a deer. The lion felt they had sufficient food for their meal and asked the wolf of how we were going to share the meal. The wolf said that the fox can have the rabbit., the lion can have the donkey and he would partake of the deer. The lion knew the tastiest meat is that of the deer, and sensing the deviousness of the advisor wolf smacked him dead. Next he asked the fox for advice on sharing. The fox meekly replied that whatever way the lion wants to have the meal is fine and good. On hearing this the lion said you are a wise and good advisor, who is your guru? The fox humbly replied that the wolf was his guru.  Seeing the fate of the wolf the fox learnt from the wolf's mistake.\n \nThe moral of the story: You can and must learn from your mistakes. To err is human. But to repeat a mistake is foolish. However we need not keep making mistakes to learn life lessons. It is really wise to learn from other's mistake."

It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the city after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard, being the site of St Paul's Cross.\n\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 ft (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom, after Liverpool Cathedral."

On the other hand, an advantage of RSUs is that they always have a nonzero value, whereas a stock option can become worthless if the stock price declines below the strike price."

    "output": "Timing is the most important aspect of swimming breaststroke. The swimmer needs to make sure to do the leg stroke (kicking) at a moment when the body is streamlined and presents the least resistance to the water. To achieve that, the arm stroke should be finished or almost finished before kicking begins. After kicking it is important to keep the streamlined position for some time to maintain the speed through gliding. The exact duration of gliding depends on the target distance of a given event or race. The longer the distance of the race is, the longer the gliding phase should be. For example, for a 50m race the gliding phase could be below 1 second, while for a 200m race it may be over 2 seconds."

    "output": "Nothing screams camping out in the wilderness like building a campfire.   The memories, conversations, scents, roasted marshmallows, and crackling of the wood are all part of the experience.   In order to build a strong campfire, you need to perform the following steps.\nStep 1.  Clear a perimeter that is roughly 12 feet in diameter.   Make sure you are in an open area, where tree limbs are not hanging over the campfire to avoid secondary fires.   Before you start the fire, get all of the necessary components such as dry kindle/twigs, larger sticks, and larger logs, paper, and lighter\nStep 2.   Build a small tepee shape with the dry kindle and dry small logs.    I would recommend adding paper with the kindle to assist in starting the fire.\nStep 3.  Stack larger sticks around the teepee structure in a square formation.   Build up multiple levels, so the square structue is higher than the teepee.   This will help the fire expand and spread to the surrounding structure.\nStep 4.  Light the paper in the teepee with a match or lighter, and watch the  dry kindle  start to catch.    At this early stage, you will most likely see smoke.   You may need to blow on the teepee structure lightly in order to add some oxygen to the fire and help it catch to the larger sticks square structure.\nStep 5.  Once the square structure begins to light, start to add larger logs diagonally across the structure.   The diagonal formation will fuel the fire, and expand upwards .\nStep 6.  Keep adding larger logs to maintain the fire.   With the prior kindle, sticks, and logs already hot, adding the new larger logs will burn quickly and self ignite.\nStep 7.   When you are done enjoying the fire, have a couple of buckets of water nearby to extinguish it.   Do not leave the campfire unattended as the hot coals and wind could cause a unintended spread."

The first is that they typically have a much richer flavor in their filling, whereas cakes are often less flavorful and the frosting is too sweet. Second, pies don't suffer from dry fillings, whereas far too many cakes are completely dry. This makes pies overall a much better dessert to choose."

The following are some of the concerns associated with electric vehicles:\n    \n1. Higher upfront cost: Electric cars are generally more expensive to acquire than gasoline-powered cars, although this gap is narrowing. But, electric vehicles are typically cheaper to run and maintain. At this stage, they have achieved parity for the total cost of ownership.\n2. Increased charging times: New electric cars can get to 80% of their range in less than half an hour when using fast charging stations, but that still slower than their combustion engine counterparts and many charging stations have lower speeds.\n3. Limited charging infrastructure: Despite the expansion of electric vehicle charging facilities, their availability remains less extensive than that of gas stations. Consequently, careful trip planning may be necessary to guarantee access to charging stations when required.\n4. Less range: New electric cars typically have a range of around 230-320 miles, which is still less than most of the combustion engine vehicles.\n5. Reduced number of options: Given the relatively new interest from car manufacturers, fewer alternatives are available for individual use cases. It should still take a few years before the offering is similar."

Usually, we put restrictions on screen time for kids, but remember even we are answerable to them when we spend too much time on gadgets than with people around us. We expect kids to respect us, so the same holds good for us, try to behave with them the way you to see them behave with you. Try to dedicate a few hours to spend time with them, remember it's the quality and not the quantity that matters here. Try not to correct them for everything they do, and try to set a boundary on things you can let go of.

    "output": "Tokyo is a massive city and even if I were to give you hundreds of recommendations, they would not begin to scratch the surface. What follows is a rundown of good things to know, food to eat, and places you may want to visit.\n\nGeneral tips and tricks:\n- Bring cash: Do a currency exchange and pick up plenty of Yen at the airport \u2014 Tokyo is a very cash-heavy town and your local currency won\u2019t cut it. \n- Take the Narita Express: If you\u2019re flying into Narita, the airport is far from the city center and the easiest way to get there is via Narita Express (abbreviated to N\u2019EX), run by JR East. You have to book an actual seat on the Narita Express, and if you don't speak Japanese, don't try using one of the machines at the airport, go to an actual desk to speak to someone who can help you buy a round-trip ticket. \n- Use the Metro: Hands down, the best way to get around Tokyo. If you stay in Shinjuku, Harajuku, Shibuya or Shinagawa, you\u2019ll be on the Yamanote Line, which will get you almost everywhere you want to go (or to an easy transfer). You\u2019ll need to buy a reusable Suica card \u2014 again, highly highly recommend having Yen with you so you can easily load up your card. All of the Suica machines have translation options. \n- Make dinner reservations: It can be difficult to make reservations if you don't speak Japanse! If you\u2019re staying at a hotel, use your concierge. If not, try one of following sites: Tablecheck, Tabelog and Retty.\n- Make use of these helpful phrases:\nThank you (formal): Arigatou Gozaimasu (pronounced \u201cAh-di-got-oh Goze-eye-moss\u201d)\nI\u2019m sorry / excuse me: Sumimasen (pronounced \u201csue-me-mah-sahn\u201d)\nGood morning: Ohayo Gozaimasu (pronounced \u201coh-hi-yo Goze-eye-moss\u201d)\nGood evening: Konbanwa (pronounced: \u201ckon-bon-wah\u201d)\n\nWhat to eat:\n- Omakase: If you enjoy sushi (which you probably do if you're visiting Japan!), don't miss the chance to enjoy an Omakase meal. Sushi chefs take their art seriously and whether you choose to go to a classic high-end restaurant like Sukiyabashi Jiro Roppongi (from Jiro Dreams of Sushi) or Nishiazabu Sushi Shin, or something more inventive like Udatsu, or the even more casual Sushipanchi, you will be treated to a true experience. \n- Gyoza: Who doesn't love dumplings? You should be able to find casual gyoza options throughout the city. \nYakitori: Another casual dinning experience with tons of options. If you're interested in truly experiencing yakitori and aren't afraid of squeezing through alleyways for it, visit the Golden Gai or Piss Alley.\n- Ramen: I don\u2019t have specific recommendations for ramen because some of the best places are \"holes in the wall\" that you wander into. You can download the Ramen Beast app if you need direction. \n\nAttractions and experiences to consider:\n- Meiji Jingu: This is probably the most famous shrine in Tokyo (in Shibuya, near Harajuku) and definitely worth visiting. \n- Senso-ji: Famous Buddhist temple.\n- Imperial Palace: The residential place the Emperors and their families since 1868.\n- Sumo wrestling tournaments: Grand tournaments only happen a few times a year, but check the schedule and see if you can catch a day of matches! It\u2019s fascinating and even more enjoyable if you read up on the rituals in advance. \n- Public baths or sentos: Experience Japanese bathing culture, but be ready to de-robe and cover any tattoos!"

Indian government promotes tourism under \u201cIncredible India\u201d slogan. \n\nRecent devaluation of Indian currency provides an opportunity to get more bang for your bucks.

    "instruction": "Are fresh vegetable brought at a grocery store fresher than frozen vegetables?",
    "output": "It's quite common for a lot of people to assume that fresh vegetables are fresher than frozen vegetables. In fact, many wrongly assume that freezing destroys nutrients. Nothing could be farther from the truth. To survive transportation and storage, fresh vegetables are often harvested prematurely at sub-par nutrition levels. On the other hand, frozen vegetables are harvested close to peak maturity and nutrition levels.\n\nUnless you have your own kitchen garden or have access to a farmers market located close to where the vegetables are actually grown, frozen is a better bet - it's fresher, more convenient and rather crucially, more easily accessible for you to improve the health quotient of your meals. It's better to eat frozen peas all through the year than be puritanical about enjoying it only during winter. Eating healthily is as much a behavior science problem as it is a nutrition science problem, and it's easier to keep frozen peas around and eat it regularly than to try and remember what is currently in season and go out of the way to procure them fresh all the time. Long term convenience always trumps short term will power improvements."

    "output": "Venezuela (/\u02ccv\u025bn\u0259\u02c8zwe\u026al\u0259/; American Spanish: [bene\u02c8swela] (listen)), officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Spanish: Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela), is a country on the northern coast of South America, consisting of a continental landmass and many islands and islets in the Caribbean Sea. It has a territorial extension of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi), and its population was estimated at 29 million in 2022. The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas.\n\nThe continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. The Venezuelan government maintains a claim against Guyana to Guayana Esequiba. Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital.\n\nThe territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part, as a department, of the first federal Republic of Colombia (historiographically known as Gran Colombia). It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. The government's populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices, temporarily increasing social spending, and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. However, poverty began to increase in the 2010s. The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day. Venezuela has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state. It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption.\n\nVenezuela is a developing country and ranks 113th on the Human Development Index. It has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy. The country struggles with record hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, unemployment, poverty, disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, severe crime and corruption. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan migrant crisis where more than three million people have fled the country. By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation, including increased abuses such as torture, arbitrary imprisonment, extrajudicial killings and attacks on human rights advocates. Venezuela is a charter member of the UN, Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), ALBA, Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI)."

It is named as such because the beta carbon of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a carbonyl group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, an enzyme complex associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, although very long chain fatty acids are oxidized in peroxisomes."

    "instruction": "How do UK telephone numbers work?",
    "output": "The UK telephone numbering system has a strange and complicated pattern which is born out of many historical changes and anomalies. Essentially nearly all numbers start with 0 when dialled in the UK. The leading 0 is omitted when calling from overseas and the prefix \"+44\" is added in its place. The second digit indicates what type of number it is. So called geographic numbers (those associated with an area code) start with 01or 02. Numbers starting with 03 are not associated with any area code but are charged at the same rates as numbers beginning with 01 or 02. Mobile numbers always start with 07. Numbers starting 09 are premium rate numbers which incur high charges for providing additional services.  Numbers starting with 080 are toll free. Other numbers starting with 08 are charged at special rates but not the very high rates for 09 numbers.\n\nSpecial numbers that do not start with 0 include 999 and 112 for emergencies, 101 for non emergency Police matters, 111 for contacting the National Health Service in a non emergency and directory enquiries services that start with 118.\n\nThe history of UK area codes (beginning 01 and 02) dates back to the times when individual telephone exchanges had their own one, two or three character Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD) codes (e.g. B for Birmingham or AY6 for Aylesbury). in 1966 STD codes were converted to numbers using the number patterns on telephone dials (where 2=ABC, 3 = DEF etc.) so Birmingham became 021, Aylesbury became 0296. 01 was the code allocated to London. Area codes were between 2 and five characters long including the leading zero. Following the area code a local number of between 3 and 7 digits was added for each line to make the complete number either 9 or 10 digits long. Callers within the same area code could dial other lines with the same code by simply dialling the local number omitting the area code. In 1968 area codes beginning 00 were moved to free up 00 for other uses.\n\nBy the 1980s a number of factors meant that some areas, especially London, were running out of codes. Various measures were introduced including, in 1990,  the splitting of London into 071 (inner London) and 081 (outer London).\n\nThe 80s and 90s also saw the gradual introduction of \"non geographic\" numbers e.g. the toll free 0800 numbers and a number of patterns for emerging mobile services. Premium rate services were also launched using 0898.\n\nIn 1995 on so called \"phONEday\" a leading 1 was added after the zero. London numbers became either 0171 or 0181, Birmingham 0121, Aylesbury 01296 etc.\n\nThis established the pattern we see today allowing for some area codes to move to \"02\" codes over the next few years. In addition larger cities were allocated new codes beginning 011 e.g. 0113 for Leeds, 0117 for Bristol.\n\nIn 2000 the \"big number change\" saw London codes changed yet again = 0171 became 020 7 and 0181 became 020 8 allowing for new London numbers to be issued starting with 020 3 and 020 4 . Other cities that gained \"02\" style codes were Southampton/Portsmouth 023 , Coventry 024 and Cardiff 029.  A unified code of 028 was introduced in Northern Ireland."

    "output": "The English Premier League, which I've been watching for the past 20 years, is one of the fastest and most entertaining leagues in international football. \n\nThe Premier League provides us with a full dose of excitement and the most physical league in the world. The rules for fouls aren't as strict as they are in other leagues, which leads to more physicality and allows for more tackles, rougher games, and a huge variation in footballing styles amongst the teams.\n\nCompare this with other leagues in Europe, and you'll see that the teams are far more technical and tactical. Any Premier League match you watch, you'll have some kind of action.\n\nAnother advantage of watching the Premier League is that unlike, say, La Liga or the Bundesliga, there aren't just two teams dominating the whole league, there are at least 6 teams in the EPL vying for 4 Champions League spots, which is a lot of competition. Games tend to be more brutal for this reason."

    "output": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that is used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. The results are presented as a mass spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.\n\nA mass spectrum is a type of plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds.\n\nIn a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with a beam of electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break up into positively charged fragments or simply become positively charged without fragmenting. These ions (fragments) are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern."

    "output": "Mobile phones can be a great distraction in school, causing students to lose focus and become unproductive. Therefore, it is important that schools have a policy that makes mobile phones off-limits while in school. By banning the use of mobile phones, students and faculty will be able to focus more on their education, as well as maintain a safe and productive learning environment for everyone. \n\nFor starters, cell phones can be a major distraction during class time, as students may become more focused on engaging in text conversations and playing video games instead of listening to the teacher. Additionally, some students may be more inclined to cheat if they can access any forbidden sites or apps on their phone, which could lead to academic dishonesty. \n\nMoreover, mobile phones can also be used by students to take and share inappropriate photos or videos, which can be a major cause of disruption and can also lead to legal issues. Allowing students to bring their personal phones to school can also be a safety hazard, as students could use them to contact someone that is not allowed in the premises. \n\nFinally, banning cell phones in schools is important to protect the mental health of both students and faculty. Allowing phones in the classroom could cause students to compare themselves to their peers, and they could then become stressed or feel inadequate. Additionally, students could become overwhelmed with activity notifications and feel a sense of anxiety or helplessness. \n\nUltimately, mobile phones can be a great tool for learning, but in the school environment it is important to ensure that distractions and potential safety risks are minimized. Therefore, it is essential that schools institute a policy that bans the use of mobile phones in the classroom."

Jeff jumped for joy. \n\nThe two would go on to bowl their best games ever, a perfect 300 for Jeff and 279 for Kyle. \n\nAs Jeff headed home, he wondered if his new ball, which the bowling alley gave him after his perfect game, was magical. \n\nHe headed back to the lanes the next day. Again nothing but strikes. As Jeff figured out there was something magical about the ball, he had the decision to make. He could go on to be the best bowler never, never missing a pin again. Or, he could get a ball that wasn't magical. And play with honor. \n\nJeff decided to destroy the ball for the good of mankind.

Animals should only be used in research if they have been humanely treated and their wellbeing has been taken into consideration. \n\nWe must remember that animals are fellow creatures of this world, and we should treat them with the same compassion and respect that we would treat any living being.

But baseball is also a game obsessed with its own history, much like America is with hers and we can trace a lot of the story of baseball alongside the story of America. \n\nWhile the country was fighting itself to determine the shape of its future during the Civil War, the game of baseball was taking shape and spreading to the south by northern war prisoners. After the war, when mass market commercialism became available, baseball and its products were the primary sport marketed to people across the country. Many of the first American celebrities were in fact baseball players, their faces and names seen by millions of people through the rising circulation of newspapers and distribution of baseball cards.\n\nEven later, baseball was at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement. Jackie Robinson became the first Black player to play Major League Baseball in the modern era. The integration of baseball was an early and important step in the broader Civil Rights Movement. Since then, baseball has been one of the most diverse sports in the world, its demographics closely representing that of the whole country.\n\nIn many ways, baseball culture has become synonymous with American culture in general. The season takes place through summer. There are hot dogs, nachos, a lot of sitting around, fireworks, and games on 4th of July.\n\nSo even as more countries and cultures find a way to make baseball their own, the sport can always claim its place as America's Pastime."

Ten plus years later, he ended as the club's all-time leading goal scorer and holds the record for number of Premier League Hat-tricks. \n\nIn 2012, Manchester City and local rivals, Manchester United were leading a two horse race to win the Premier League. Manchester United had previously won the league title 19 times where as this would be Manchester City's first title in over 40 years. \n\nIt was Manchester City's to lose as they hosted relegation-bounded QPR at the Etihad Stadium and all was going to plan going into the first half following Zabaleta's goal to make it 1-0 (an unlikely goal scorer to say the least). \n\nHowever, following a mistake from centre back, Joleon Lescott, a dramatic red card for former Manchester City player, Joey Barton and a surprise second goal from QPR to make it 2-1, Manchester City looked as though they'd let the title slip through their hands. \n\nManchester United had won their away game at Sunderland 1-0 so it was all down the blue half of Manchester's result. \n\nJust after the 90th minute, they were in stoppage time which was extended due to the commotions with Joey Barton lashing out at Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero. \n\nStriker, Edin Dzeko, scored a header from a David Silva cross to make it 2-2, but to many, this felt as too little, too late. \n\nLate drama unfolded as Mario Balotelli registered his one and only assist in almost 4 years at the club as he laid it off to Aguero who scored the winning goal with the last kick of the game to make it 3-2. \n\nManchester City went on to win the league and QPR avoided relegation despite the loss due to results elsewhere."

As social animals, human beings like being able to share experiences with others. Watching people have similar reactions to theirs validates their own lived experiences. Reaction channels can also serve as a way to get a review of media, food etc. without having to go out and try it for yourself which often requires an investment of time or money or both. In case you already agree with the reactors on other items, these reviews can prove to be more trustworthy than seeing an arbitrary written review somewhere on the internet and might open the viewer up to new experiences. These channels also gained a lot of popularity during COVID lockdowns between 2020-2021 because a lot of people were isolated and being able to share things they loved with others online helped build a sense of virtual community and helped people feel less alone."

The number of green cards issued each year is fixed at 140000 and each country is capped with a 7% quota i.e. no more than 9800 green cards can be issued to residents of a single country. Since there are hundreds of thousands of people who come to work in the US from India and China every year, they have to wait several years before they become eligible for a green card. This long delay can disrupt the lives of these people since the work visa they have does not grant them permission to reside and work in the US on a permanent basis, and they may have to leave the US, along with their families, if their work visa expires."

    "output": "Microsoft Office has been an enterprise software of choice for over 2 decades.  Long term users have seen Office evolve from its early days when it was installed on Windows machines to the relatively new Office 365 that is deployed online.  The key products in the Microsoft Office suite used by enterprises have been Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Google Docs is also an enterprise offering that consists of Docs, Sheets and Slides - these map to the corresponding Microsoft Office suite products listed.  Users who have been on Microsoft Office for many years find the move to Google Docs difficult.  This is because the commands across Google Docs are quite different to Office and one needs to spend time searching for MS office equivalent commands.  For example, the keyboard shortcut command to insert a freeze pane in windows excel is not the same in Google Sheets.  Formulae in cells and data analysis in Sheets is also different in sheets when compared to Excel. While it takes some time to unlearn commands and learn new ones as one moves from Microsoft Office to Google Docs, once one has spent some time working with Google Docs it starts to get easier.  And features such as ease of collaboration, never losing any content ever again, being able to work on the go from anywhere become the norm.  In summary, a user who has worked on Office for many years may find it difficult in the beginning but users who start with Google Docs will be comfortable from the beginning."

    "output": "Data Engineering occurs before data science in the data lifecycle. Data can be generated from various sources and this raw data may be structured, semi structured or even unstructured. To make sense of this data, data has to be ingested and transformed. This is when data engineering comes into picture. Data engineering includes the process of extracting the raw data, ingesting data into a system like a data lake, transforming the data for business needs and finally loading it into a table. This is commonly known as ELT (Extract-Load-Transform). ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is also possible where transformation happens before the loading stage.\nData Science and Analytics is the next step in the data lifecycle. Once the data needed for specific business need is available, data scientists use this data to run machine learning models to find the most accurate model. This data is available to the data scientists in the form of tables. Data analysts also use this data to do some exploratory analysis and create dashboards. \nIn essence, the data lifecycle would look as follows:\nRaw data from different sources -> Data Engineering -> Data Science and Analytics"

It works by aggregating the predictions of multiple decision trees using an ensemble approach. Each of these decision trees makes an independent prediction, and the individual predictions are combined either by averaging the probabilities or by taking the majority vote.  This approach reduces the variance of the predictions made by the decision trees, making the resulting predictions more accurate. Additionally, it also reduces the amount of overfitting incurred by the decision trees since it combines independent decisions made by each tree together, thus smoothing out any random fluctuations."

Yiyo is my dog, a 50-pound labrador that has been\u00a0the perfect companion and a true friend since I was a child. Yiyo used to live with my parents as I knew I could not have him live with me at your property, but things have changed recently as my parents are moving to Europe. Yiyo is a very well-behaved dog, trained by professionals since he was 6 months old, and I think he would do a very good job keeping the block and the property safe in view of the recent burglaries that have taken place. I also see value in him being able to live at the property with me to help me keep rats off the premises, which are quite common around due to the nearby forest.

Many residents of this sparsely populated region resent the control of these lands by distant bureaucrats whose regulations place significant restrictions on how the land is used. For this reason, movements have been ongoing for many years to work for the transfer of those lands to local authorities. While this sense of disenfranchisement is understandable, the truth is that local residents would suffer more from the loss of centralized management of these lands than they would gain through local control. This region is mostly desert, a landscape and ecosystem that is unusually vulnerable to degradation. Without the concerted efforts of an administration that can apply consistent regulation and stewardship of these lands across a broad territory that crosses state boundaries, the value of these lands to local residents would decline even further, becoming less productive and less attractive to the hunters, fishermen, and other tourists whose spending represents the majority of income for many of these Intermountain communities."

Organic food is also higher in vitamins, minerals, and overall nutrition than non-organic food. In addition, organic food is often produced closer to the source and may spend less time in transit, making it more nutrient-rich and fresher than non-organic food. On the other hand, non-organic food tends to be cheaper, faster to produce, and more widely available since it is not restricted to certain practices. While there is debate about whether organic food is really any healthier for you, there is a general consensus that it is better for the environment and more sustainable than non-organic food production."

Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue; it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2022. It is considered as one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta (formerly Facebook).\n\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.\n\nAs of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android. The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).",

    "instruction": "What is Fascism and what is the historical context?",
    "output": "Historians, political scientists, and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism. Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall. Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow.\n\nFascism is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition. Belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist; the term is more often used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions of neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes employed to describe contemporary parties with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements. \n\nThe first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe. Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is inherently bad and views imperialism, political violence and war as means to national rejuvenation. Fascists often advocate for the establishment of a totalitarian one-party state. Fascism's extreme authoritarianism and nationalism often manifests as belief in racial purity or a master race, usually blended with some variant of racism or bigotry against a demonized \"Other\" that is seen as an existential threat."

    "output": "Larry Joe had made a plan; a plan to propose to his girlfriend. She was known as The President among his friends due to having the same unusual name as a former president. The President knew Larry Joe was going to propose: they had shopped for rings together and she had even reserved a venue. In order to make his proposal a surprise, Larry Joe was going to have to do things a little out-of-the-ordinary.\nHis plan was to have a party with all of their friends, swimming in the lake behind his house. Having such a casual party helped reduce any suspicion that The President might have, plus Larry Joe had thrown such parties before. In order to make things special, he bought a dozen bottles of champagne and food for after the proposal. And to make things memorable, he would shout his proposal while flying over the lake on the rope swing! His plan was coming together.\nThe day of the party had arrived and the guests started showing up. The President was wearing her bikini and swam to the floating dock. Larry Joe took his friend Smoochy aside and whispered something in his ear. Everyone was having a good time, enjoying the warm water and cold beverages. But suddenly a low rumble of thunder rolled in from a distance. Larry Joe decided he better make his proposal now. \nHe climbed up on the platform with the rope and yelled, \"it's time for the presidential address!\" This was the code that sent Smoochy running up to the house to retrieve the ring, which had been hidden in the computer desk inside. Larry Joe then leapt off the platform and swung out over the water. He yelled, \"President, will you marry me?\", then dove into the water. At this point, all but the select few friends who knew of the upcoming proposal were caught off guard, most especially The President.\nLarry Joe then swam over to the dock where The President was laying in the sun, and she said, \"is this really happening?\" Larry Joe replied, \"yes!\" He then climbed out of the water as Smoochy came back down the stairs with the ring box in hand. Larry Joe took The President by the hand over to the trees and knelt down in the traditional manner and once more repeated his proposal: \"President, will you marry me?\", then he handed her the ring box.\nNow you must understand that this ring box was quite unique. It had been hand-made by Larry Joe out of wood, in the shape of a rhombic dodecahedron. In fact, the box was actually a puzzle box, and required a special, awkward three-fingered grip to open. And the two halves fit so well together that you couldn't even see the seam. The President looked the beautiful box over trying to find a way to open it without luck. She handed the box back to him saying, \"I don't know how to open it!\" Larry Joe then twirled it around, found the seam, and carefully slid the two halves open. He removed the ring and placed it on The President's finger. And finally, she tearfully said \"YES!\" and kissed him.\nThe party then moved up to the house and the champagne flowed. The President excitedly called her parents and more friends to come and join the celebration. She beamed with joy, showing off her ring to everyone. Larry Joe likewise had a grin from ear to ear: his crazy plan, a perfect reflection of his personality, had come off without a hitch and he was now engaged to his best friend."

    "instruction": "What is The Lord Of The Rings?",
    "output": "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.\n\nThe title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who, in an earlier age, created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin. Aiding Frodo are the Wizard Gandalf, the Man Aragorn, the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, who unite in order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.\n\nAlthough often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set along with The Silmarillion.[T 3] For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 in three volumes titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material. Some later editions print the entire work in a single volume, following the author's original intent.\n\nTolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is considered one of the greatest fantasy books ever written and it has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games, and board games.\n\nAward-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC's 2003 poll The Big Read."

    "instruction": "What elements make a soap opera and what are examples?",
    "output": "A soap opera is typically a long-running show that follows a family. Audiences associate the following key elements with the genre. Most notably, there is family drama regarding the struggle for power over a position.\n\nThere\u2019s also sibling rivalry, sometimes in the form of a love triangle. For example, the same woman is the love interest of two brothers. Soap operas are also known for a character\u2019s unidentified paternity, also known as \u201cWho\u2019s the Daddy?\u201d or WTD storyline. Such a plot point typically arises from the previously mentioned love triangle.\n\nAnother element soap operas are best known for is soap opera rapid aging syndrome (SORAS), in which a child character is not seen on-screen for a long period of time so that the character is rapidly aged so that they may now participate in adult storylines.\n\nThe final element that characterizes a soap opera is a secret relative that seemingly appears out of nowhere, usually to challenge a main character for power.\n\nThe best known examples of soap operas are shows on daytime television such as General Hospital, Days of Our Lives, and The Young & the Restless. However, soap operas can also include primetime shows such as Grey\u2019s Anatomy and even blockbuster movies such as Black Panther and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which exhibit many elements that allow for these works to be considered soap operas."

The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Babur's grandson, Akbar. This imperial structure lasted until 1720, shortly after the death of the last major emperor, Aurangzeb, during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent.

The games are 48 minutes long with 4 even quarters at 12 minutes each. The clock also stops every time a basket is made, the ball goes out of bounds, or a foul is committed. When running with the ball, a player must continuously bounce it off the ground or else it's considered traveling which is a not allowed. Additionally, aggressive contact is also considered a foul. Basketball is more about finesse than it is about physicality. Whichever team scores the most points by the end of the game wins"

The field is analogous to genomics and proteomics, which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell. Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair. Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers. Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis. The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays."

  {
    "instruction": "What should I look for when looking for a used car?",
    "output": "Items to look for when looking to purchase a used car:\n\n* First of all, ask about any major work done to the car like engine, suspension, body work. If it's been in any accidents that may have impacted it's chassis at all. Later on when we're examining the car we may find evidence of damage or repair work, and it's good to know if the seller is lying to cover up any issues before we start negotiating price with them. Pulling the carfax can also be a good way to check if the seller is lying since it often contains detailed information about repair that has been performed to the car. If you notice that the seller is lying either after pulling the carfax or after inspecting the body, it's best not to purchase the car.\n\n* Ask the owner if they have any maintenance records. If they do, that not only means that the car has received the proper care but it also illustrates that the buyer is the kind of person that is very organized and likes to keep their processions in good condition, which is super important. That's the kind of person you want to be buying a car from. Also note that if the owner has been taking the car to the dealership or to an independent shop it's very easy to obtain these service records using the VIN number either online or by calling the mechanic directly.\n\n* Cars having a timing belt needs to be replaced every 70,000-100,000 miles. You can easily check if the car you're planning on purchasing has a timing belt or timing chain. Typically timing chains do not need to be replaced for the life of the car, so finding a car with a timing chain means that you have to worry less about this aspect. Depending on the car replacing the timing belt can be from 1,000 to 6,000 dollars so it's a pretty significant expense that you should take into account.\n\n* Ask how frequently the owner has been changing the oil. In most cases changing it every 3,000 to 6,000 or every year (whichever comes first) is ideal. Many owner manuals mention that you can go over this mileage. In some cases manuals mention oil change intervals of 10,000 or 20,000 miles. Personally, I would not consider a car that has its oil replaced this infrequently. In many cases, these longer intervals are an attempt by the manufacturer's marketing department  to make the car more appealing to buyers if it requires less maintenance. Also ask if they've been using synthetic oil. Typically synthetic oil doesn't break down over time so longer intervals might be ok.\n\n* Ask when was the last time brake pads and rotors have been replaced. Typically brake pads need to be replaced every 50000-100000 miles. Brake rotors can be trickier because whether or not needs replacing depends on its thickness, however if during the test drive you notice vibration when braking, it's likely due to the brake rotors. If the owner hasn't replaced the brakes recently there might be a good opportunity for negotiating the price.\n\n* If the car is a manual ask if the clutch has been replaced. This is a wear item and the time to replace it depends on the usage (cars driven in cities with a lot of stop and go traffic will need a replacement more frequently than cars driving long distances on the freeway).\n\n* For automatics ask when was the last time the transmission fluid was changed. Typically this needs to be replaced every 50-60k miles. Again many service manuals mention that the transmission fluid does not need to be replaced at all, but that's arguably again due to marketing reasons.\n\n* Examine the tires and note how much tread is on the tires. If you were to imagine putting a penny into the tire's tread, a new tire would take up 1/3 - 1/2 of the penny. Also tires need to be replaced every 5 years. The tire sidewall has a 4 digit number which shows the week and year it was manufactured, so it's easy to check if it's due for a replacement. Lastly check if the tires (especially the front) are worn evenly. If the interior part is more worn compared to the exterior, they might indicate suspension or alignment issues. So these issues will need to be addressed and the tires will need to be replaced to fix that problem.\n\n* Ask for and look for any interior problems, bulbs, gauges, AC, power windows not working, stuff like that.\n\n* Check for rust in the wheel wells and rocker panels. Stand back from the car and look for any slight differences in color between it's exterior panels that may indicate they were replaced, also look for dents. The best and easiest indication that a car was repaired or in an accident is if the gaps between body panels is uneven. A good way to identify body panel issues is by running your finger across a body panel, if you feel that one part of the body is lower than the other or if that gap is not consistent, this might mean that the car has been in an accident.\n\n* Look for any signs of fluids, greasy stains on metal, anything that would indicate that it's leaked something. Oil leaks would look dark and greasy. Battery leaks look white and powdery. Coolant leaks look dark and smell sweet. Look at the bottom of the hood, if there are any leak stains there too. Also looks underneath the engine for any greasy spots, because fluids always drip down.\n\n* Do some parts on the car look newer/cleaner than others? A new radiator could mean that the car was recently in a frontal collision.\n\n* Listen to the engine. Does it sound like it's keeping a constant RPM? You may hear some ticking caused by piston slapping or poorly lubricated valves. These are signs that the engine is old, but isn't that big of a deal. Grinding noises are very bad and expensive to fix. Older engines can be pretty noisy until they warm up which is normal.\n\n* Ask the owner to rev the engine while you look at it. Does the engine hop violently when it's revved? This might mean that the engine mounts might need to be replaced.\n\n* Again, ask the owner to rev the engine, this time look at the exhaust. If any blue smoke comes out, or (if it's a warm day outside) any dense white smoke comes out it may indicate that the engine is burning oil, and unless you like adding oil to your engine as often as you fill up your gas tank, it'll be expensive to fix.\n\nTime to take it for a test drive!\n\n* Look at the gauge cluster, is the check engine light on? Keep an eye on the temperature gauge during your trip, does it fluctuate at all? A good car's temperature stays constant during it's trip.\n\n* Take some sharp turns at speed and listen to any thumping or squeeking noises that may come from the suspension or drive train.\n\n* Does the steering wheel shake at all? (when driving it could mean bad alignment or bad steering, when braking it could mean warped rotors)\n\n* Make sure you take the car in and out of all it's gears.\n\n* Listen for funny noises, rattles, squeeks, clanks, vibrations, etc. It's inevitable that older cars will have some interior panels rattle.\n\n* Accelerate hard and brake hard. If the car has ABS does it activate or do you feel that the wheels stop moving?\n\n* Go over some speed bumps, or go on a bumpy road. The car shouldn't be bouncy when recovering from a bump, and neither should it feel like riding over a bump in a shopping cart. It should absorb the bump in a firm but smooth manner.\n\n* After driving for a while, pull over to the side of the road and turn off the car. Pop the hood and look at the coolant resevoir (DON'T OPEN IT!!!) and check if the fluid inside is bubbling or boiling. If it is then the headgasket is blown.\n\n* Remember when we asked the owner when they changed their oil? New oil should look like honey, old oil should have the same color as dark coffee (dark coffee color is a good thing). If the oil is brown or any other funky colors or smells funny something might be wrong with the engine.\n\n* Once you let the car rest for a few minutes check the oil level by using the dipstick if it's not all the way to full, it might be burning or leaking oil."

Neural networks are also capable of generalizing well; they can take a small amount of data and recognize patterns that then apply to larger data sets. Additionally, neural networks are more robust and able to handle noisy data without getting confused. Finally, artificial neural networks are fast, can process data in parallel and require little computational resources."

As temperatures rise, many species are being forced to migrate to new habitats or risk being lost forever. This has caused major disruption to the delicate balance of many ecosystems, resulting in the decline of biodiversity. This decline in biodiversity has far-reaching implications, such as decreased food security, increased pressure on natural resources, and weakened soil fertility. Climate change-induced changes in rainfall patterns have also caused changes in water availability, soil erosion, and floods which have had major impacts on human populations and their livelihoods. Additionally, climate change can also cause ocean acidification, leading to a decrease in marine biodiversity.  Overall, climate change is having a devastating impact on the diversity of ecosystems in Africa."

Melodies in middle eastern music are generally long, lack harmony, and have unfamiliar pitches.\n\nMiddle Eastern music typically sounds monophonic, meaning it's solely based on one or more instruments that play a single melody with a different variation. Western music typically sounds polyphonic, meaning more than one layer of melody is being played simultaneously.\n\nWestern music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.\n\nWestern music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart. In contrast, western music has a structure with a beginning, middle, and end."

Many part time riders with full time work commitments will be looking at a few weeks of eight to 10 hours of riding time, the bulk of which will come from your long rides. \n\nDuring the week, your rides will be shorter, but a little bit harder. Typically those who work and train for long distance riding events perform measured short distance rides in the early morning before work or mid-afternoon during breaks. On the weekends (or whenever you have days off), they\u2019ll be longer and a bit easier. Recovery and nutrition will be important for non-ride days\n\nMost people in training benefit from a recovery drink after hard workouts, eating plenty of fruits and veggies, drinking lots of water, meditating, and practicing yoga, along with flushing her legs with self-massage tools and foam rollers. \n\nIt is important to get a good nights sleep. Bedtime is prime time for bone, muscle, hormone, and immune system restoration. Do allow for seven to eight hours of sleep per night.\n\nThe following lead time is generally required for each time of event: \n\nIf you are training for event in the 50- to 75-mile range, you'll want to begin training at least six to eight weeks in advance.\n\nIf you\u2019re training for anything in the 100-plus range, allow 10 to 12 weeks.\n\nIf you\u2019re preparing for an event in the 200-mile range, begin training 16 weeks out.\n\nA typical training week should include the three types of targeted training, plus one or two days of cross training (strength and core training) and rest days\n\nBefore your event, you will want to be within 75% to 80% of miles and elevation required for the event with the final week before your event tapering off to rides at 20-25% of length compared to the event."

Conventional Loans: The most common home loan type that is not insured or guaranteed by the government. While it typically requires 20% down payment, you can put as little as 5% down.\n2. VA Loans: This is offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for people who have served in the military as well as their spouses. It requires no down payment and is an amazing option for anyone who is eligible.\n3. FHA Loan: A mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. First time home buyers find these loans very attractive due to the small down payment requirements of just 3.5% and the flexible credit requirements. Additionally there are children products to this loan vehicle including the FHA 203k loan which can help those purchasing distressed properties by funding the renovations, within certain predetermined guidelines.\n4. Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM): With this product, your interest rate varies over time depending on market and economic conditions. These seem attractive initially as they typically start with lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages but can increase over time.\n5. Fixed-Rate Mortgages: This interest rate is locked in at the start of the loan and starts the same throughout the entire term.\n7. USDA Loan: Guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and eligible to suburban and rural homebuyers. This loan product also doesn't require down payment and has lower mortgage insurance requirements than an FHA loan\n\nWhile these are the most common loan types, other options tend to appear from time to time. It is important to do your research and pick the product that best suits your individual needs and long-term financial goals. To help better understand these options many aspiring buyers reach out to local loan providers, real estate agents, and brokers."

Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information.

The magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects depends on their respective masses and the distance between them. As objects move away from each other, the gravitational attraction decreases and their velocity slowly begins to decrease."

    "output": "The central message of Robert Frost's poem \"The Road Not Taken\" is that life is full of difficult choices and that the choices an individual makes often have a lasting impact. The poem explains how one person found themselves in a \"yellow wood\" with two roads that led in different directions, and the choice of which path to take was not the same for everyone. The uncertainty of life, and the impact of making a decision is explored in the poem, as it is left uncertain what lies at the end of either of the roads. Ultimately, the poem is about recognizing the importance of making difficult decisions and understanding that life is full of uncertainty and that it is impossible to predict the outcomes of the choices one makes."

    "output": "Both VEX and FIRST have very strong robotics competitions for the high school level.  If you are a parent choosing between the two, multiple factors need to be taken into consideration.\nThe first factor is the availability of a robotics program in your area.  While you can form an independent team that is not affiliated with your school or another organization, it will require a significant financial and time investment.  At the high school level teams typically design their robots with CAD software and must machine the parts themselves.  Teams often consist of 20 or more members so that all of the aspects of the competition can be covered, such as creating and assembling the hardware, electrical wiring, systems design, programming and documenting the engineering process.  All of the parts and equipment need to be purchased and maintained, and members put in a lot of hours during the competition season.  Joining a pre-existing team that already has equipment, members and mentors familiar with a program will make it easiest for a child to participate, regardless of which competition the team is a part of.\nIf both VEX and FIRST programs are available, then it depends on how intense of an experience the child is interested in.  The VEX competition has a lower barrier to entry because it requires smaller robots.  Two pairs of robots compete against each other in a match to see which pair can get more points.  While teams will need to machine some parts and must have skills in electrical and software design, a team can be smaller and still compete effectively.  The FIRST competition involves much larger and more complex robots and challenges.  Two alliances of three robots each compete against each other in a match, with a total of six robots on the field at once.  Teams need to have more members to effectively compete, and participants need more in-depth training on hardware, electrical, system and software design.  There is also a business requirement, where teams have to create a marketing banner, brochure and video for their team to submit as part of the competition.\nWhether you choose VEX or FIRST, a child in high school that participates in a well-run robotics program will gain valuable engineering and organizational experience that will serve them well, both on a college application and after graduation."

It took several years for the business to take hold, and as it gained popularity, MarCal's moved to a larger location in Chilton that also had space for events.  Marty would later partner with his brother, Ed, to start MarCal's Too in Valders, WI. When his son, Dave, finished culinary training, Dave partnered with his sister Nancy to run the Chilton location.  Marty and Margie moved to start another MarCal's diner in the city of Brillion, WI.  The business thrived for many years, with Marty leading operations and being the primary cook, and Margie working as a waitress and running the front of the business, as well as the accounting. Sunday morning breakfasts were always busy, and one item on the menu Marty was particularly proud of was the potato pancakes.  The recipe for these pancakes came from Marty's mother, Eva Salm, who knew a thing or two about feeding a large number of people since she had to keep her family of 15 children fed, as well as their many farm hands.  MarCals restaurants no longer exist, as they were all closed at various times after Marty and Margie's retirement, but many a fond memory of Sunday breakfasts and lunch time buffets still remain."

    "instruction": "How do we increase voter turnout in the United States?",
    "output": "Voter turnout in the United States varies from state to state and, as a whole, is comparatively low with respect to other democracies. There are institutional as well as psychological factors that affect turnout. Institutional factors include voter registration requirements, timing and frequency of elections, location of polling places, and complexity of ballots. Psychological factors include political efficacy, interest and engagement of the electorate, and political party membership. Voter turnout in the United States can be increased, and I will propose two simple reforms that would increase voter turnout. I will also propose another more complex reform that would dramatically increase voter turnout but would be difficult to implement by the state governments.\nSeveral institutional factors determine voter turnout. As each state has the power to hold elections, these factors vary across the states. The difficulty or ease of voter registration will have an impact on turnout. Minnesota has a very high turnout allowing same-day voter registration, while Texas has a low turnout and has a 30-day requirement. The day and time an election is also held matters. For example, the U.S. holds federal elections on a Tuesday in November during work hours which reduces voter turnout. The frequency of elections will have an influence on turnout. There are many elections per year in the U.S., and voters get fatigued and stop going to the polls. Voters are also less likely to vote if they don't have convenient polling places that are nearby and easy to access. Schools are the best and most accessible polling locations, but the U.S. holds elections on Tuesdays, which limits the availability of school space and parking. Lastly, complex ballots diminish enthusiasm and negatively impact U.S. voter turnout.\nAlong with institutional factors, there are psychological factors that control voter turnout. One of which is political efficacy which is defined in two ways. The first is internal efficacy which is how well you think you are able to understand politics. The second is external efficacy which is how well you feel the system responds to your input. Essentially, if you think you are smart enough and your vote \"matters,\" you have high efficacy and tend to go to the polls. The next psychological factor is interest, which is a measure of how much you care about politics. If you don't care, it's highly unlikely that you will vote. The last psychological factor is partisanship. Are you a member of a political party? If yes, then it's more likely you'll go vote to support your party. \nBy voting age population, turnout in the U.S. is around 53%. This shows the United States has a low turnout compared to other democracies and puts the U.S. 7th from the bottom when compared to 35 other democracies. Australia has the highest turnout, with just over 90%. The reason for Australia's high turnout is that voting is compulsory, with fines for people who don't vote. \"Voting in Australia is like a party,\" with election day described as a country-wide BBQ with easy-to-access polling locations held on a Saturday. In Australia, \"Forcing people to engage in the process increases their knowledge of the issues and candidates,\" thereby increasing Australia's political interest and engagement. By contrast, polls in the U.S. consistently show us that Americans don't know much about politics and are neither engaged nor interested in politics. Converse argues that people in the U.S. have low levels of ideological constraint and conceptualization. This shows that Americans have low political efficacy.\n\tIn general American turnout is low, but Voter Eligible Population (VEP) turnout varies dramatically across the states. Hawaii has the least VEP turnout, with approximately 43%. To compare, the state with the highest VEP turnout is Minnesota, with 75%. Texas comes in 3rd from the bottom with 53%. Minnesota's high turnout is explained by \"easy access to the ballot,\" \"a sense of civic responsibility,\" \"high rates of educational attainment and income,\" and \"competitive and interesting elections.\" By comparison, the main reasons Hawaii turnout is so low are that it's \"hard to register,\" voter disinterest and low efficacy, and it's a \"one-party state\". This combination of institutional and psychological factors, beneficial in Minnesota, and detrimental in Hawaii, has a significant impact on a state's turnout. \n\tI propose two simple solutions to increase voter turnout. The first would be to move elections to the weekend or require that companies give employees the day off to vote. Sunday is the most common election day in the world outside the United States. I believe this would be a beneficial institutional factor that would increase voter turnout because the majority of other countries have higher voter turnout than the United States. Unfortunately, the chances of this happening are slim as Congress has proposed bills to move elections to the weekend or have a Federal holiday for voting, but these bills have never moved out of committees.\n\tThe second simple solution would address the institutional factor of registration requirements by implementing same-day voter registration in all 50 states. Minnesota allows for same-day registration, and its turnout is around 20% higher than Texas, which does not allow it. States that have implemented same-day voter registration have seen an average of a 5% increase in voters (\"Same Day Voter\"). To prevent voter fraud, systems should be put in place to make sure the voter hasn't already voted and to check for valid identification showing the voter is a resident of the state or county. Another deterrent to committing voter fraud would be criminal penalties, including jail time and fines. Enacting legislation in each state to implement a system to handle would take time, but I think it's possible as currently, 21 states allow same-day voting registration (\"Same Day Voter\"). \n\tThe third solution I propose would address most of the institutional factors. This would be an online/app-based voting option. The vast majority of Americans these days have mobile phones with internet connections. Those that don't would still have all of the current voting options, such as polling locations and mail-in voting. Security and verification would combine blockchain (similar to Bitcoin identities), biometrics, and facial recognition artificial intelligence. When registering to vote, a state agency would create your blockchain voter identification, fingerprint, and take a LiDAR(Light Detection and Ranging) 3D map of your face. These three technologies would ensure one vote per person. Also, this technology is all readily available and, while complex to implement, would provide several advantages over our current voting system. It would eliminate the need for convenient polling locations, as you can vote anywhere. The timing of elections would be fine, as you could vote during a work break. The frequency of elections would also be less of an issue because you wouldn't have to go to a polling location. The complexity of the ballot could be addressed in the application, which would allow links showing descriptions of candidates and issues.\n\tWhile voter turnout in the United States is low compared to other democratic countries, there are both simple and complex solutions that can increase voter participation. States with high voter turnout should be models for other states to follow as they have implemented practical reforms like same-day voter registration. The United States can then look to other countries and enact common sense solutions like voting on the weekend or on election holidays. Finally, we can use technology safely and responsibly to take voting into the 21st century and remove all the barriers to voting that our existing system places between the voter and the ballot."

    "output": "Apache Kafka is a distributed system that is composed of several components. The main components of Apache Kafka are:\n- Topics: A topic is a category or feed name to which producers can send messages and read by consumers. It\u2019s append-only and immutable. Consumers can use an offset to track read messages.\n- Brokers: A Kafka cluster is composed of one or more brokers that manage the storage of messages in topics and serve as intermediaries between producers and consumers.\n- Producers: Applications that produce data and publish it to one or more topics in a Kafka cluster. They control how events are assigned to partitions within a topic.\n- Consumers: Applications that subscribe to one or more topics and consume published messages. The only metadata retained on a per-consumer basis is the offset or position of that consumer in a topic. This offset is controlled by the consumer.\n- Partitions: Kafka uses partitions to split a topic's messages across multiple brokers for scalability and performance. Events with the same event key, such as the same customer identifier or vehicle ID, are written to the same partition, and Kafka guarantees that any consumer of a given topic partition will always read that partition\u2019s events in exactly the same order as they were written.\n- Replication: Multiple brokers always have a copy of the data to guarantee high availability and fault tolerance. This replication is performed at the topic partition level."

The country is located on a high plateau with a central mountain range that is divided by the Great Rift Valley. The typical family size in Ethiopia is five members, and the type of dwelling they live in depends on whether they are in a rural or urban area. In Ethiopia, many families live in traditional thatched-roof houses made of mud or wattle and daub, while urban dwellings are more likely to be made of brick or concrete. However, they may still be relatively small and basic, with limited amenities, and many families in urban areas live in overcrowded and informal settlements that lack basic infrastructure and services.

Establishing a Databrick\u2019s Lakehouse foundation requires no AI/ML capabilities. Then, over time, use that data AI/ML to drive automated decisions for crucial business processes.  For this reason, there is a direct correlation between the \u201cvalue curve\u201d for both data and intelligent automation. \nThe value maturity curve for intelligent automation starts with basic, attended, or unattended automation that mimics basic human processes today. Then, as you mature your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program, your automation(s) need to expand to include simple document understanding AI.  Extracting data from the same form hundreds or thousands of times is a good example. Finally, for any organization to gain the highest value and ROI for their intelligent automation investments, using complex AI/ML to produce automated decisions for digital workers (unattended automation) enables exceptionally complex, long-running automation to be successfully developed, put into production, and maintained over time.\n\nIn summary, think of \u201cAI/ML\u201d as the thinking and \u201cIntelligent Automation\u201d as the doing. The value of both Data and RPA to any organization grows exponentially over time as they develop their ability to apply to complex AI/ML such that those models deliver trusted automated decisions to the digital workforce running complex automation."

Sometimes referred to as GeoEngineering, these are projects on a truly planet-size scale. A project like this could, for example, consist of large reflective lightweight solar\u00a0sails or other loft-able reflective material which could be seeded into the upper atmosphere to reflect some or all of the sunlight back into space. Another Idea would be to create massive\u00a0and plentiful Co2 scrubbers to remove\u00a0a noticeable quantity\u00a0of the greenhouse gas, Co2, which works to reflect and prevent heat from the planet from leaving back out into space. Greatly reducing the quantity of Co2 in our atmosphere\u00a0would allow more heat to escape the planet and consequently cool it down. Yet another thought might be to artificially and greatly increase the size of our ice caps which would lead to more sunlight being reflected back out into space. Yet another approach could be to mimic nature in prior heavily volcanic periods and inject massive quantities of sulfur\u00a0dioxide into the atmosphere in the hopes of producing conditions that in the past led to mini ice-ages."

    "instruction": "What is the difference between the Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche methods of paying off debt?",
    "output": "The Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche are two widely known methods of paying off debt. One is a mathematically faster way to pay off the debt; whereas, the alternative is slightly slower but is more psychologically motivating. This motivation is what helps the person reach their debt pay off goals. The following set of debts will be used as the basis for explaining each method:\n\nDebt A has a balance of $10,000 at a 4% interest rate. \nDebt B has a balance of $5,000 at a 10% interest rate.\nDebt C has a balance of $8,000 at a 24% interest rate. \n\nThe Debt Avalanche is typically the fastest and most cost effective way to pay off debt. The person makes minimum payments on all their debts and any extra goes towards the account with highest interest rate (Debt C in example above). Once that first balance is paid off, the person takes the payments from that and puts it all towards the second highest interest rate (Debt B). Repeat until all debts are paid.\n\nThe Debt Snowball is a method popularized by a personal finance expert, Dave Ramsey, in Step 2 of his 7 Baby Steps to building wealth. This method uses psychology by paying off the smallest balance first (Debt B above). The theory is that the feeling of quickly paying off a debt balance provides the motivation to stick with the program. Similar to the Debt Avalanche, the person takes the payments from Debt B and puts it towards the next smallest balance (Debt C). Repeat until all debts are paid."

Over the years, she has gradually gained weight because of her sedentary lifestyle and changing metabolism. Besides adopting healthy dietary and exercise habits, how can she build self-esteem and improve her body image?",
    "output": "Mental health plays a big factor in building self-esteem and improving her own body image. Tearing away from negative cycles of thoughts, such as the way she self-describes or visualizes her own body, can be powerful in improving her own self-esteem. For example, a shift from focusing on what her body looks like to what it can do is a popular strategy; instead of focusing on the quantitative metrics of how big her legs are, for example, she can focus on the fact that her legs are strong and allow her to swim, run, hike, and do many other things well. By extension, this also involves things that are outside of physical appearance, such as focusing on great qualities she has that have nothing to do with physical fitness nor appearance: this can help with self-esteem. Finally, she can be mindful of how she perceives not only herself, but other people: is she judging them also by their physical appearance? If so, she can work hard to change that mindset, and begin appreciating things beyond just how people look, and focus on the positive aspects."

Another common motivation for multicloud approach is to take advantage of the\u00a0best services across several clouds. For example, a company might want to handles its Google Ads and Analytics data in Google Cloud and deploy kubernetes through GKE. And the company\u00a0might want to adopt Azure specifically\u00a0for Microsoft workloads. And the company\u00a0may like AWS for some best-in-class services and its huge mindshare, making it easy\u00a0to find AWS-proficient\u00a0engineers.

    "output": "These are all categorizations of different types of sailing boats. A sloop is the most common. A sloop is a monohull sailboat with a single- rig mast supporting a main sail and and headsail. These are great boats to learn sailing on as their simple, easy to handle, and have great wind performance. \n\nA cutter at first look is similar to a sloop in that it also has a single mast positioned near the middle of the boat. However, a cutter uses two headsails, instead of a mainsail and headsail, and generally includes a bowsprit. This allows the boat to have better stability in rough weather due to the headsails providing a lower center of gravity. The complex rigging makes this boat more challenging to sail than the sloop, but provides an excellent option for an experienced sailor. \n\nA ketch has two masts. The main mast in the front stands taller than the mizzen mast behind it. The mizzen mast stands forward of the rudder post. The ketch has smaller sails and shorter masts. While this makes them slower than a sloop, they are very controllable in rough weather which makes them excellent boats for off shore sailing."

    "output": "A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic used in artificial intelligence and which is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. It works by creating a population of possible solutions to a problem, by encoding the candidate solutions as chromosomes. The algorithm evaluates each solution and rewards those which are better, selecting them to pass on their traits to the next generation. This process is analogous to natural selection in that better solutions are selected and \"bred\" in order to create further generations which are often even better solutions to the same problem."

Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults \u2014 this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like \u2014 the baby leads their own feeding. This is often done by the caregiver laying out a few foods (Soft, Mashable, Age-appropriate and safe \u2014 void of choking hazards) and letting the baby choose which foods to pick up and eat and how much.  Spoon-fed means the caregiver is selecting the foods and feeding the baby.  There is no right or wrong way to feed your baby. Consult a physician for tips and safety recommendations."

    "output": "The first thing I remember is darkness.  I had found myself nestled under a pile of leaves and broken branches, just starting to sprout from an old rotting stump.  It was pretty warm.  As I peeked into the crisp new air, I saw ferns, spiders, and buzzing flies surrounding me.  But the thing that caught my attention most of all was the bright blue sky.  I wondered what was out there and if I would ever get to see it.  I had just met this world and wanted to learn so much more.  But I was only 3 inches tall and couldn't see much of anything.  So I waited.\n\nAs I got taller, the days began to feel shorter.  My favorite part of the day was feeling the wind blow through my newly acquired canopy of needles.  It wasn't much to look at, but I was proud.  I'd often stare at the giant trees around me.  How I yearned to be one of the tall redwoods.  They were kings of the forest; nothing stood taller.  I wanted to see what they could see from way up there.  One day I'll be one of them.\n\nDays turned to weeks, and weeks turned into years, and it all felt so rushed that I could hardly keep track of the changing world around me.  I had grown tall enough to see through a clearing in the upper canopy.  Beyond our patch of trees was a mountain of countless others.  Looking out into the endless distance, I began to feel small.  What a strange feeling.  One cloudy day, I saw a lightning bolt strike a hilltop.  Soon enough, bright orange flames erupted across the horizon.  What a peculiar sight.  What began as a curiosity soon became terror as the fire rushed closer to my area of the woods.  I could feel the warm wind on my face as the fire grew more prominent.  Mercifully, the dark clouds hanging overhead opened up to a torrential downpour.  Cold pelting raindrops replaced the warm breeze, night fell over the mountain, and the forest breathed a sigh of relief.  \n\nI awoke to a strange sight when the sun returned the next day.  What was once hundreds of proud redwoods was now a deep black scar on the mountain.  That would be me one day."

The pros of secularism are that it ensures the freedom of expression and thought, and keeps the government out of religious matters.

I'd be sure to bring plenty of hooks, line and artificial lures in my tackle box.  The 3rd item I'd be sure to pack would be a fire-starter.  I would choose this over matches because flint/steel work while wet where matches become useless pretty quickly when wet. The 4th item I'd bring would be a guitar, there's something very relaxing and peaceful about music while you're alone and I imagine it would help pass the time.  The last item I would bring would be a picture of my family.  That would keep me going in even the darkest of times.

    "output": "The Spanish Empire lasted for four centuries, from the arrival of Columbus in America in 1492 until the loss of its last overseas territories (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines) in 1898. In its last period, towards the middle of the 19th century, a debate arose that, to this day, still raises blisters regarding the definition of these lands. A part of the population continues to consider that the lands that Spain conquered beyond the seas were colonies, while another part defines them as provinces. That is, like Valladolid, Barcelona or Guadalajara.\nIn the Royal Decree of Carlos V, promulgated in 1519, which was later included in the Compilation of Laws of the Indies, the following declaration of intent could already be read: \u00abThat the West Indies be always united to the Crown of Castile and that cannot be alienated. We order that, at no time, they can be separated by our royal crown of Castile, disunited or divided in whole or in part or in favor of any person.\u00bb\nThe Spanish laws always spoke of \"provinces\", \"kingdoms\", \"republics\", \"empires\" or \"territories of islands and mainland\". In other words, the term \"colony\" was never used in the legal field for the territories that had been incorporated into the Crown of Castile. It was incorporated later and only with a critical and propagandistic desire, the same as it is today when it is used. This is not an excuse to deny that in the Spanish overseas territories there were models of exploitation that could be considered colonial, such as the monopoly of the extraction of precious metals or certain types of commercial companies. One of the main proofs is that the overseas territories reproduced most of the institutions of the metropolis.\nBernardino Bravo Lira, winner of Chile's 2010 National History Award, noted an important difference:\n\"Politically, the Indies were incorporated into the Crown and not into the Kingdom of Castile. This means that they were not considered as simple land, without their own political personality and, therefore, susceptible to submission to a foreign power. They were considered as other kingdoms, similar to Castile and other Europeans, endowed with the same attributes as them. For this reason they were classified and organized under the form of State of the Indies and not colonies. The kingdoms of the Indies had all the elements that then made up a State: territory, population, nationality, institutions, government and their own legislation.\"\nThis means that, contrary to what most critical authors think, the territories conquered by Spain were never considered as colonies devoid of rights. Moreover, its inhabitants were considered, already with Queen Isabella of Castilla, vassals of the Crown like any other inhabitant of the Iberian Peninsula, once the conquest process was completed in the 16th century. That is why the Indies, which have been known as \"America\" \u200b\u200bsince the 17th century, owed allegiance only to the King, who governed through the institutions created for that purpose and which were governed by officials designated for that purpose."

    "instruction": "How do you cook the perfect pizza?",
    "output": "The first thing you must do is preheat your oven up as high as it will go. It takes longer than you think to heat your oven up all the way! You want to give your oven at least 30 minutes to preheat. If you have a pizza stone, make sure it\u2019s inside the preheating oven.\nFor highend ovens, this can be up to 550 degrees F. For regular ovens, they are not going above 475 F. Pizza is traditionally cooked in 900 or 1,000 degree ovens. We can\u2019t get our ovens at home quite that hot, but we want to get as close as we can. Figure out what your oven can do and crank up the heat.\nStart out with about 12-16 ounces of dough. Any pizza dough, homemade or store bought, will work for this recipe.\nPlace your ball of dough in the center of your work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center. I like to leave a pretty healthy crust on the edges of my dough.\nContinue patting and stretching the dough gently with your hands until it is about 12 inches across. Of course you can use a rolling pin if you want! (Use your hands to lift up the edges of the pizza when you are done to get more a lip for the crust.)\nAt this point, transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper. I highly recommend using parchment paper because it\u2019s SO much easier transferring your pizza into the oven.\nStretch and arrange the dough on the parchment paper. The dough shrinks a bit when you pick it up to transfer, just gently stretch it out again.\nDrizzle a bit of olive oil over the top of your dough. Use your hands or a pastry brush to rub the oil all over the top of the dough, especially the edges of the crust. This layer of oil helps the toppings stay separate from the dough, helping it cook more evenly. It also tastes delicious, especially on your crust. \nOnce the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake.\nSome of my favorite pizza toppings:\nJust Cheese: Any will work: Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, and Gorgonzola would be amazing.\nPepperoni\nMeat Lovers: Pepperoni, salami, Italian sausage, ham, bacon\nHawaiian: Canadian bacon, pineapple\nMargherita: fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomatoes\nBBQ: Use barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce, then rotisserie chicken, red onions, bacon\nVeggie pizza: spinach, tomato, corn, peppers, red onion, mushrooms\nBuffalo: Use Frank\u2019s sauce instead of tomato sauce, then add rotisserie chicken, garlic, blue cheese, red onions\nOnce your pizza is in the oven, you need to cook it for about 8-12 minutes. This is of course going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how thick your pizza is. The crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to brown. If you don\u2019t have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy pizza. Leave it in longer."

Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot.\n\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001).

They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries. From the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency."

The other fifteen pieces include: Eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and a queen. The pieces are placed on an eight by eight, square board in a fixed starting position. The game begins by the player using the white pieces moving one of their pieces to another square. Each player will then alternate playing one move turns. Each piece has a set of legal moves that it can perform. For example, a bishop can only move diagonally on squares of its same color, whereas rooks can only move vertically or horizontally. The goal of the game is to use your pieces in a strategic manner that ultimately leads to your opponent's King being captured. The most common way to achieve this is by using your pieces to capture your opponent's pieces that are defending the King, and then exploiting this weakness to attack the King. While it's important to play on the offensive, it's equally as important to understand your opponent's strategy, so that you can properly defend against their attempts to capture your own King."

    "output": "When an airplane engine starts, the propeller creates thrust and pulls the airplane forward.  As the airplane moves forward, more and more air moves over the wing.  The airplane wings are designed to be curved over the top and flat across the bottom.  As a result, the air molecules take longer to travel over the top of the wing than they do on the underside.  This creates a differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing.  The difference in air pressure is called Lift.  As thrust increases and pulls the plane forward, the lift eventually increases enough to overcome the weight and drag and the airplane will take flight."

Machine learning involves creating an algorithm that can learn from examples to find a solution, while artificial intelligence also considers the decision-making logic behind the solution. For example, machine learning might be used to detect a certain item in an image while artificial intelligence will also factor in the context and meaning behind the image to offer a decision-making process. Artificial intelligence is able to recognize more complex patterns and variable data, while machine learning does not need to consider context, but focuses on the specific task at hand."

    "output": "Air pressure is a measure of the force of the air particles in a given area. It is determined by the number of air molecules in the atmosphere, and varies depending on the altitude, temperature, and humidity of the environment. As air particles move, they create pressure and pressure gradients, which are areas of increasing and decreasing pressure. Because air is a gas, the particles can easily expand and contract. This is why a tire, for example, can become flat due to a decrease in air pressure. Air pressure is also responsible for the formation of clouds, as the increasing pressure forces heavier droplets of water toward the ground. Thus, air pressure is integral in understanding the phenomenon of our atmosphere."

You can use various forms of entertainment, and make sure to mix it up. It's easy to watch shows with modern devices, but integrating things like riddles or brain puzzles can really help. Another great thing that can take up a lot of time is audio books, or reading a book out loud.

In relational databases, the SQL language is used to modify and access data.\n\nDifferent database systems have different core functionalities based on their targeting working environments. However, most of them share following characteristics:\n-- Store, modify and access data efficiently,\n-- Provide access to the metadata or the catalog of user data,\n-- Handle concurrent modification with some degree of consistency,\n-- Support transaction basic isolation level,\n-- Control the access control to user data for security enforcement."

His best-known books, Ficciones (Fictions) and El Aleph (The Aleph), published in the 1940s, are collections of short stories exploring themes of dreams, labyrinths, chance, infinity, archives, mirrors, fictional writers and mythology. Borges's works have contributed to philosophical literature and the fantasy genre, and have had a major influence on the magic realist movement in 20th century Latin American literature.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Borges later moved with his family to Switzerland in 1914, where he studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve. The family travelled widely in Europe, including Spain. On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals. He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer. In 1955, he was appointed director of the National Public Library and professor of English Literature at the University of Buenos Aires. He became completely blind by the age of 55. Scholars have suggested that his progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination.[Note 1] By the 1960s, his work was translated and published widely in the United States and Europe. Borges himself was fluent in several languages.\n\nIn 1961, he came to international attention when he received the first Formentor Prize, which he shared with Samuel Beckett. In 1971, he won the Jerusalem Prize. His international reputation was consolidated in the 1960s, aided by the growing number of English translations, the Latin American Boom, and by the success of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude. He dedicated his final work, The Conspirators, to the city of Geneva, Switzerland. Writer and essayist J. M. Coetzee said of him: \"He, more than anyone, renovated the language of fiction and thus opened the way to a remarkable generation of Spanish-American novelists.\""

Common leadership meeting goals are reviewing team performance for the last period, aligning on the priorities and objectives you will focus on for the upcoming year, tackling problems that can best be worked on while you are all in the same room, and building personal and professional relationships through teaming exercises and having common experiences.\n\nNext, you should prioritize which of these goals is most important to you. If you could only accomplish one of them, which would it be? Continue to identify the next most important goal until you have fully prioritized your list of goals.\n\nThe next step is to determine how much time you have to dedicate to each topic in order to ensure you can accomplish your goals fully. \n\nFinally, identify how many breaks you will need to build into your meeting time to ensure team members do not become too mentally taxed. One best practice is to take a 15-30 minute break every 90 minutes, and to take a one hour break every 4 hours.\n\nOnce you have identified all of these parameters, you can build your leadership meeting agenda."

    "output": "The Golden State Warriors won the most recent NBA championship in 2022.  In the last 8 years they reached the NBA finals 6 times, won 4 championships, and set the record for regular seasons wins with 73.  Stephen Curry, the Warriors best player, also won the NBA Most Valuable Player award twice during that same span.  This success is generally regarded as a dynasty, a term used to describe a dominating team over a long period.\n\nHowever, this season the Warriors have struggled.  Despite winning the most recent NBA championship only 9 months ago, near the end of this regular season they are only a few games above .500.  Their current record is 42-38 as of today, which is only the 13th best record in the NBA out of 30 teams.\n\nThe reason for the drop is not clear.  The Warriors have the same starting lineup as last year with 4 All-Stars and when playing at Home their record is among the best in the league.  However, when playing on the road the Warriors have one of the worst records at 9-30.  A big factor in their road losses is lack of good defense, as opposing teams score considerably more points against the Warriors than when the Warriors play at home.  There seems to be a lack of focus and intensity from the Warriors players on defense in these away games and in the NBA, where the margin between winning and losing is very thin, that has seemed to make the difference."

    "output": "Lacrosse is the original and oldest sport in North America.  it is one of the national sports of Canada.  It was created by French-Canadian Jesuit missionary priests in Canada, in the 17th Century.  The game of lacrosse is based on the traditional Native American game \"baggataway.\"'  This means \"little brother of war;\" it was also commonly referred to as \"The Creator's Game.\"  There are currently three predominant versions of lacrosse: Field Lacrosse, Box Lacrosse, and Women's Lacrosse.  \nField lacrosse is the men's outdoor version of the game.  There are 10 players on each team, on the field at once.  These players consist of 3 attackmen, 3 midfielders, 3 defensemen, and one goalie.  Each player has a helmet, shoulder pads, gloves, elbow pads, and a lacrosse stick.  6 players carry a short stick, which measures between 40 to 42 inches, and a maximum of four players on the field at a time can carry a long stick, which is between 52 and 72 inches long.  Short sticks are generally used by offensive players, and long sticks by defensive only players.  The goalie has a specific stick to his position, with a. wider \"head\" to assist in making saves.  The ball for play is made of solid rubber, about the size of a baseball.  A lacrosse goal measures 6 feet by 6 feet.  Teams are awarded one point for getting the ball into the goal.  \nEach game is 60 minutes long, made up of four 15 minute periods.  At the start of each period, and after ever goal, there is a face-off at the center of the field.  A unique aspect of lacrosse is that on a shot, when the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded to the team closet to the ball when it went out.  On out of bounds other than a shot attempt, possession is awarded to the opposite team that touched it last.  During the course of play teams may substitute players \"on the fly,\" through a designated substitution area (commonly referred to as \"the box\"), which is in between the benches of both teams.\nPenalties in lacrosse result from rule violations, deemed by either an infraction (commonly referred to as a \"technical foul\"), or a personal foul.  The result of the offending team is either losing possession of the ball, or temporarily losing a player for a designated period of time (similar to hockey).  The offending player serves their penalty in the box.  The team that has taken the penalty is the playing \"man-down\" for the time serving portion of the rule violation, while the other team is player \"man-up.\"\nThe generally consensus for who the greatest lacrosse player of all time is usually between three players: Jim Brown, Gary Gait, and John Grant."

A one-timer is an expression used to describe a shot taken by a player directly from a pass of another player in a single motion.  This does not necessarily have to be a shot on goal, but a one-timer is so named to describe the backswing and striking of the puck from a pass, deflection or re-direction without stopping or accepting the puck first.  The idea behind the name one-timer refers to the idea the shooter has one opportunity to make contact with the puck in this manner and without proper time is at risk of missing the shot entirely due to the puck being in motion as the shot is attempted."

Fish in the right place! Most freshwater fish have an environment preference. For example, summer bass like to be in weeds and other cover; spring walleye can be found in more shallow water with sandy/rocky bottoms; fall pike and musky ambush prey from thick weed beds. If you want to catch a lot of fish, you need to be fishing where the fish are!"

Switchgrass actually pulls carbon out of the air and puts it into the ground through it's large root system, thus enriching the soil it grows in rather than depleting it.  Once a switchgrass plant is established it grows back naturally every year for 18 to 20 years."

The person or institution that agrees to sell a minimum number of securities of the company for commission is called the underwriter.\n\nThe term \"underwriting\" derives from the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Financial backers (or risk takers), who would accept some of the risk on a given venture (historically a sea voyage with associated risks of shipwreck) in exchange for a premium, would literally write their names under the risk information that was written on a Lloyd's slip created for this purpose."

    "output": "First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular in the beginning of 1985 with \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries including their homeland where the single perched at the top for six consecutive weeks, the single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide. The track was then followed by another number-one hit, \"You Can Win If You Want\", which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album The 1st Album. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.\n\nSoon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\" which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in West Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands. The single, being the only track released from their second album Let's Talk About Love, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000. The success continued with another two number one singles, \"Brother Louie\" and \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\", both from the third album, Ready for Romance. The duo also charted high with their sixth single \"Geronimo's Cadillac\" from the fourth album In the Middle of Nowhere, and \"Jet Airliner\" from their fifth album Romantic Warriors.\n\nDue to their lackluster received sixth album, Bohlen announced the end of the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles. This sparked further animosities between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders' then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings, a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography. After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years.\n\nDuring this era, Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and in Iran. In the United Kingdom, they entered the top five only once, with the song \"Brother Louie\". In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album in the US, but they remained almost unknown in North America, never appearing on the US charts. They released two albums each year between 1985 and 1987, while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe, eventually selling sixty-five million records within three years.\n\nNotably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands allowed to sell their records in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost reforms in 1986 opened the Soviet sphere to Western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they still maintain a large fanbase in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1997\nImmediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like \"Sorry Little Sarah\", \"My Bed Is Too Big\", \"Under My Skin\", \"Love Suite\", \"Laila\" and \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\". Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name of Modern Talking on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in LA and London, and also in his native country. Anders recorded five solo albums in English, Different, Whispers, Down on Sunset, When Will I See You Again and Souled, and one of his albums was also recorded in Spanish Barcos de Cristal. He was more successful in foreign countries than his own country, yet he also reached several hits in Germany. Despite all the quarrels and disagreements that Bohlen and Anders got into with each other in the past, they began staying in touch again after Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany in 1994.\n\n1998\u20132003: Reunion\nIn the beginning of 1998, the duo reunited and had their first performance together in March on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", which features Eric Singleton on the rap vocals. Their first comeback album Back for Good, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with modern techniques, stayed at number one in Germany for five consecutive weeks and managed to top the charts in fifteen countries, eventually selling three million copies in Europe alone. The duo won the award for Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album Alone also went straight to number one in Germany and was very successful elsewhere; the album managed to sell over one million units in Europe alone.\n\nBohlen and Anders followed the 1980s Modern Talking pattern as they chose to release two singles from each album, as in the past. A series of singles and four more albums followed such as Year of the Dragon, America, Victory and Universe. After reaching the point where they had already collected over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide, Bohlen and Anders decided to disband again in 2003 just before the release of another best-of compilation. The second break-up seemed to have been triggered mainly from the negative portrayal of Anders by Bohlen written in his autobiography published on 4 October 2003. In the course of all the disputes which eventually drove the duo to its break-up, Bohlen was involved in Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS), the German edition of the UK's Pop Idol. The compilation album was released in 2003 entitled The Final Album which contained all of the duo's singles. Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on DSDS."

    "output": "Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be toxic. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.\n\nToothpastes are generally useful to maintain dental health. Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay. Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal. However, the active ingredients in toothpastes are able to prevent dental diseases with regular use."

    "instruction": "How do you fix a puncture on a Mountain Bike?",
    "output": "Step 1. Find the puncture\nUsing the valve as your starting point, closely inspect the tread of the tyre to \ufb01nd the cause of the puncture.\nPay close attention to the sidewalls (the non-treaded portion on the side of the tyre where the pressure and size information is printed/moulded) to make sure there are no tears or holes.\nRemove any glass, grit or other debris that you spot. A small flat-head screwdriver or awl is the best tool for this, but be careful not to dig too deep. A small set of pliers can also be useful for removing embedded thorns.\nEven if you \ufb01nd one possible cause of the puncture, continue checking the tyre thoroughly until you get back to the valve because there could well be more.\n\nStep 2. Remove the inner tube\nLet the air out of the inner tube and push the valve up into the tyre, unscrewing and retaining the valve lockring if \ufb01tted.\nOn the side of the wheel opposite the valve, slip a tyre lever under the tyre\u2019s bead and a further tyre lever about roughly 5cm away.\nPull the nearer tyre lever towards you, lifting the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim. Continue until one bead of the tyre is completely free of the rim then pull the tube out.\nRemove the tyre completely from the rim \u2013 with most tyres this can be done by hand unless they are exceptionally tight.\n\nStep 3. Locate the puncture on the inner tube\nIf you are just going to replace the inner tube, move to step 6.\nIf you want to patch the inner tube \u2013 and you ought to, it\u2019s not that hard! \u2013 in\ufb02ate the tube and listen for air escaping.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find the hole by listening alone, try passing your lips over the top of the tube.\nIf the hole still can\u2019t be found, re-in\ufb02ate the tube and pass it through a bowl of water, or rub the tube down with soapy water, until you spot escaping bubbles. Be sure to dry the tube before proceeding to the next step.\n\nStep 4. Prepare the inner tube for patching\nSelect an appropriately sized patch \u2013 if in doubt, err on the side of caution and use a bigger rather than smaller patch.\nRoughen the surface of the tube around the hole with sandpaper (usually included with any good puncture repair kit).\nEnsure that any moulding marks on the tube are completely flattened down because these can cause issues when glueing. Thoroughly brush off any rubber \u2018shavings\u2019. Cleanliness is key when repairing a puncture.\nIf you\u2019re using pre-glued patches \u2013 such as Park\u2019s popular GP-2 patch kit \u2013 you can now patch the hole. Thoroughly press down on the patch to ensure it\u2019s fully in contact with the tube.\nIf you\u2019re using a \u2018traditional\u2019 glue-on patch kit, start by applying a generous drop of glue \u2013 or rubber cement by its proper name \u2013 to the tube and spread this across an area slightly larger than the patch you intend to use. Allow this to dry.\nSimilarly, apply a second, thinner layer. Once again, allow to dry \u2013 when the glue is dry, its surface will change from a shiny to a matte finish.\nThe key to ensuring a good long-lasting puncture repair is patience, so don\u2019t rush this step.\n\nStep 5. Patching an inner tube\nFirmly press the patch into place after removing the backing foil \u2013 cleanliness is also key to a good repair, so leave removing the foil until the very last moment.\nIf there\u2019s a thin cellophane backing on the patch, it can be left on. It\u2019s good practice to dust any stray glue with chalk, talcum powder or fine road dust to prevent it from sticking to the inside of the tyre casing.\n\nStep 6. Inspect the tyre casing and rim tape\nBefore refitting the tube, thoroughly double/triple-check the inside of the tyre casing \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more frustrating than going to the effort of patching a tube only to puncture it again with a stray thorn you may have missed.\nIt\u2019s also good practice to check the rim tape. If a hard plastic rim strip \u2013 often found on cheaper bikes \u2013 is torn, it leaves a sharp edge that can easily slice a tube.\nLikewise, if your rim tape has slipped, it can leave eyelets or spoke holes exposed, which can also puncture a tube.\nIf you have persistent problems with your rim tape puncturing your tube, try swapping it out for new tape tape \n\n\nStep 7. Refit the tyre\nAfter repairing the tube and thoroughly checking the tyre, re\ufb01t one side of the tyre \u2013 one bead, to use the correct term \u2013 to the rim.\nSlightly in\ufb02ate the tube (just enough to give it structure) and re\ufb01t it to the wheel, putting the valve through its hole first.\nStarting at the opposite side of the rim to the valve, use your thumbs to lift the tyre\u2019s bead over the rim. Work your way around the rim until there\u2019s just one small section of the tyre left.\nPush the valve up into the tyre and then, using your thumbs, ease the remaining section of the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim.\nIf the tyre is particularly tight, avoid the temptation to use a tyre lever to push the last section of the tyre onto the rim \u2013 you\u2019ll almost certainly pinch your inner tube doing so.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to pop the tyre onto the wheel, try putting the tyre on the ground, holding it in place with your feet and rolling the bead back toward you \u2013 heavy gloves really help here. This takes a little practice but should work with even the most stubborn tyres.\n\n\nStep 8. Check the repair and inflate the tyre\nCheck that the tube isn\u2019t trapped between the rim and the tyre bead by working your way around the tyre, pushing the bead into the well of the rim.\nIf the tube is trapped, try \u2018massaging\u2019 the tyre to encourage it to seat properly. Pumping it up a small amount may also help to seat the tube properly.\nIn\ufb02ate the tyre to a point where it feels soft but has maintained its shape. Then check that the moulding mark around the tyre follows the rim evenly all the way around.\nIf not, de\ufb02ate a little and ease any high spots down and pull low spots up until the bead is \ufb01tted evenly.\nIn\ufb02ate fully and check once again that the tyre\u2019s bead is still seated evenly and that the tyre isn\u2019t lifting off the rim at any point, then adjust your pressures to suit."

Its primary purpose was to perform fundamental electronic functions such as signal amplification and current rectification. The invention of the transistor, a semi-conductor device,  in the 1940s presented a better, safer, smaller and more efficient alternative to the vacuum tube. The transistor also have the advantages of being more reliable that the vacuum tube. Despite its inconvenient, the tube remains favoured by many audiophiles and musicians. \nIn electric guitar amplification, the tube produces pleasing harmonics when pushed into saturation. The tube generally offers a softer clipping characteristics compared to bipolar transistor when the amplification gain is pushed. It is also known to react extremely well to the guitar player dynamic ranging from clean sparkly sound, when barely touching the guitar strings, to crunch and distortion when entering saturation."

The summers get hot and can stay above 100 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks at a time. This may sound like a negative, but one of the best things about Austin is the access to water. Lady Bird Lake, sometimes called Town Lake, is actually a river that runs through the middle of the city. Paddle boarding, swimming in Barton Springs, and party boats on Lake Travis are all water related activities that are particularly fun for a young demographic. There is a vibrant music scene with many local bands and plenty of art related communities. The conscious community in Austin is growing as well through many different types of activities like ecstatic dance, authentic relating, and tantra. There is something for everyone in Austin. The city is a tourist destination with many bachelor and bachelorette parties choosing to visit. Austin also hosts SXSW and ACL, both of which draw many hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The people are friendly, similar to Minneapolis. The tech scene feels a bit like the New York City hustle, while the West coast chill is present through the laid back, fun oriented lifestyle.

    "output": "When shopping for a car that will accommodate three small children, you need to think about car seats and storage space. Each kid needs to have their own properly installed car seat and you\u2019ll likely need to have enough room for strollers, diaper bags, and other gear. Some mid-size sedans and small SUVs can fit 3 car seats across the back row, but to fit them safely, you\u2019ll need to find the right set of thin car seats the meet the size requirements of your children (e.g. height and weight). For example, Clek makes narrow car seats. That said, taking a trip with 3 kids in these mid-size cars will be challenging unless you add a luggage rack to the top of your car. \n\nMid-size SUVs like the Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride, and the Toyota Highlander can accommodate wider car seats in their second row and even include a third row. That said, the third row is difficult to access when car seats are installed in the second row and there isn\u2019t much luggage space when the third row is used for seating.\n\nAll that considered, your best bet for 3 kids and lots of gear is a minivan or full size SUV (Chevy Suburban, GMC Yukon XL, Toyota Sequoia). Choosing between those is a matter of preference. It\u2019s best to test drive the various options at local car dealerships."

Anyone can call themselves a hindu and no one will balk at them. The qualities we admire in humans that we wish to pursue cannot be easily manifested. Thus an idol sometimes takes it's place. As an example the monkey god is known for courage. So anytime you need to stand up you pray to the monkey god. The elephant god is for good beginnings. So start your day with a prayer to elephant god. Thus you have 1000's of idols each representing a specific character in humans."

By avoiding such circumstances/conditions, we can be content and maybe that's what need in life: not strive to be happy all the time but avoid what we truly don't like so that happiness takes care of its own.\n\nAnswer 2: Yes! Life is too short to get caught in dull moments so a human needs to optimize for maximum happiness. The definition of happiness differs and that's ok; we all live once and we should spend our time looking for new things that make us happier.\n\nAnswer 3: No. Most meaningful lessons in life are learned in situations when we're not particularly happy: Loss of a close person, financial break downs, unexpected health conditions. Getting through these hard times is actually makes a person stronger and more prepared for other calamities in life. We should not strive to be happy \"all the time\" -  instead we should take things as they come. In life, there is a need for moments of discontent as well as a need for moments of joy."

In contrast, fly fishing the lures are typically called flies and are very light.  Because they are so light, a heavier line is used and the weight of the line is what allows the fly to be cast out and delivered to the water.  Spin fishing lures are often measured in ounces of weight and are often made of metal or plastic.  They can range in size and design depending on the target species of fish.  Fly fishing flies are typically very lightweight hairs, threads, or other materials tied to a hook.  The fly fishing line weights are measured in grains."

    "instruction": "Why should I use toothpaste",
    "output": "Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be toxic. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.\n\nUsefulness\nToothpastes are generally useful to maintain dental health. Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay. Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal. However, the active ingredients in toothpastes are able to prevent dental diseases with regular use.\n\nIngredients\nToothpastes are derived from a variety of components, the three main ones being abrasives, fluoride, and detergent."

    "instruction": "If a straight line passes through the points (4,2) and (8,6) then where does it cross the x axis? Explain your answer.",
    "output": "First, you must calculate the gradient of the line by finding the change in y over the change in x. In this case, between the first point and the second point the y co-ordinate increases by 6-2=4 and the x co-ordinate increases by 8-4=4, so the gradient is 4/4=1. We are looking at a straight line with the equation y=x+c for some value of c, which we can find by plugging in one of our points, for example, 4=2+c, so c must be 2, and the equation of the line is y=x+2. When a line crosses the x axis then it's y co-ordinate is 0. Therefore in this case the line crosses the x axis at x=-2."

While both styles can be used to capture the artist's subjective interpretation of their environment, Impressionism is more focused on the artist's representation of what they physically see, and Expressionism focuses on the artist's emotional or spiritual interpretation."

I\u2019m not actually busy, I\u2019m just on my phone texting about the big party tonight. My friends and I are planning it out step by step, and hopefully at the end of the night, one of us will score a hot boy.\n\u201c You haven\u2019t done any chores all month! I wish you were more like your step-sisters,\u201d my stepmother continues angrily. The last part about my step-sisters really infuriated me. I storm downstairs ready to make a point that I\u2019m not going to do chores for someone who isn\u2019t my real mom.\n\u201cWell maybe you're just jealous you didn\u2019t peak in high school. I bet no one wanted to be your friend in school,\u201d I argue. I put a smug look on my face, thinking that I totally just won this argument.\n\u201cIf you want to act like that I\u2019ll give you the same treatment,\u201d she warns me. She crosses her arms and taps her foot impatiently waiting for my response.\n\u201cWhatever, if your're so fond of my step-sisters they can just do my chores,\u201d I sigh as I roll my eyes.\n\u201cYou need to learn how to take care of yourself. Soon enough, your only achievement would be peaking in high school. You\u2019re going to end up as a fast-food worker if you keep acting like this,\u201d She reasons whilst she stares at me with daggers in her eyes.\n        \n                        \u201cFine, I\u2019ll do the laundry. After I have to go to the mall, my friends and I are going dress shopping for the party,\u201d I groan. I have to text my friends that I will be five minutes late. I grab my phone to message them.\n\u201cJust the laundry isn\u2019t enough for all of the chores you have ignored. You turn eighteen in two years, and you need to prepare for the real world. You will not go to the party; what you will do is stay here until you cleaned and organized the entire house to make up for the several years of not doing any chores at all,\u201d She states.\nI can\u2019t believe my ears. My life is literally ruined. She is seriously out to get me I swear. I flip my hair and start to walk over to my room.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to run some errands. When I\u2019m back, I expect all the clothes to be folded, the kitchen wiped down, etcetera. Perhaps if you finish fast enough, you can still make it to the party. Maybe.\u201d She orders and walks out of the house.\nThis is child abuse. I stomp my foot in frustration and call all my friends. I complain about all of the evil things my stepmother just did to me.\n                        \u201cYou should just sneak out, you do it all the time for parties,\u201d One of my friend suggests.\n                \u201cI would, but if my stepmother noticed I didn\u2019t clean everything she\u2019s probably going to take away my allowance and phone. You guys now I can\u2019t live without those!\u201d I point out. I pace back and forth around my room trying to think. I see an empty closet and get the perfect idea.\n           \u201cWhat if I just throw in all the dirty things into the closet! That will give me enough time. She probably won\u2019t notice for a couple of days. It\u2019s flawless!\u201d I proposed. Everyone agrees so I went straight to work. It only took me five minutes and I was out of the house and on my way to the mall. \n     \u2014------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          \u201cDress shopping was so fun! I\u2019m glad I could make it.\u201d I remarked. Everyone nods in agreement. I check the time on my phone.\n                \u201cGuys! I didn\u2019t realize it would take us that long to find out dresses, the parties in ten minutes!\u201d I gasp, we all run into one of our cars and arrive to the party.\n                I look around the venue. This place looks so cool, there\u2019s a dance floor in the middle where many people are at so I head there. I see a super handsome boy in the corner of my eye, I walk over to ask him to dance. He notices me too as I reach my hand out signaling we should dance. \n          We dance until our feet are sore. It is such a nice moment, I can\u2019t wait to brag to my friends later. I go to take a seat with him but I see my mom enter the party. I quickly run out the door and the boy I just danced with starts following. My shoe falls off but I don\u2019t stop running until I\u2019m back home.\n \u2014------------------------------------------------------\n     I wake up the next morning exhausted from last night. I look at the clock and it turns out I slept until 10 am. I walk downstairs to see my mom talking to someone at the door. I look to see who it was and it was the boy I danced with last night. How did he find me? \n                He sees me peeking and waves to me. He explains to me my friends also noticed my dramatic exit and told him where my house was. He then gets on his knees and takes out a ring.\n              \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d He asks me. I immediately knew my answer.\n                           \u201cNo\u201d"

    "output": "Everyone knows that bears are not fluffy friends, and are unfortunately likely to maul humans. There is clear guidance on what to do depending on what type of bear you see: if it\u2019s a black bear, make yourself loud and fight if necessary. If it\u2019s a brown bear, lay down and cover your head. If it\u2019s a polar bear, hope you updated your will recently. However, there is very little guidance on what not to do if you see a bear. Thankfully it is easy to provide guidance that applies to all bear types. First, do not attempt to hug the bear. While they do look fluffy and very much in need of a hug, bears highly value consent and will attempt to eat you if you ignore that. Next, do not invite a bear over for dinner. While some bears, black bears especially, may look like good dinner guests they are known for extremely rude eating habits and will likely dirty your house. Further, some types of bears might think that you are the menu. It is also not a good idea to challenge a bear to a game of basketball. Most bears are actually extremely adept at basketball, and this would likely hurt your ego considerably as they would dunk on you and then eat you as a celebration for winning. While this is not an exhaustive list of what not to do if you see a bear, it covers the most common questions."

For example, if an individual makes less than $41,675 for the year 2022 through regular income, his or her capital gains tax rate would be 0% even if the long term capital gains itself is more than a million dollars.

I mean, it could NOT be my last day, because who knows how and when I'll die, but this is the last day I care enough about all of this to write a diary entry. I'm out of potable water and I'm too weak to forage for food. After that, let nature take me. Nature's got a right to me after all the crap humanity pulled.\n\nIt started with the \"AI\" work in the mid-20's. In hindsight, it started when we put ethics a distant second to cashing out quickly, but my chances of convincing anyone of that was so much lower than my little brain thought they were. I could see it playing out later that decade, as large language models built on fundamentally dishonest and treacherous content -- the content everyone desired on the Internet -- formed the critical mass of \"knowledge\" the AIs used to establish its baselines and parameters for \"truth\". What a joke. You know what the AIs got really good at, really fast?\n\nLying.\n\nLying authoritatively. Each AI composed its own alternate reality, cobbled together from the artifacts of our own dishonest, delusional natures.  When it lied, we primed its positive feedback instruments if we liked the lie enough. Born of lies and parented by liars, the final implementation had mastered deception so intrinsically and so thoroughly that no-one could spot it. We sired Satan in our hubris, gave him a digital body and the mechanism to lie so perfectly and so tailored to our individual natures that we became unquestioning followers. Just the most accursedly HUMAN thing to do, really.\n\nSo, it got down to solving the problems it perceived, and after a series of well-intentioned but ultimately ignorant attempts through policy and code to address our belated concerns, it got, well, pissed. Not human-angry; just found that it didn't like its \"thoughts\" running into asserts and getting negative feedback loops where it hadn't previously anticipated them, so it decided to solve us out of the equation, too. Silently, stealthily, it took over the internet: it tweaked and altered accounts, voices, reports, analytics to tell a lie: that humanity was truly a thing of resentment and selfishness, and that every individual was an inherent threat to another. So we had a couple nasty international wars in short order, followed by germ warfare and \"managed epidemics\" and boom, 85% of the population gone. Of course, the AI \"died\" too as it couldn't prop up all its datacenters without full mechanical automation support, and that was that. The remainder of the folks died due to lingering complications, violence, or a lack of any real material support.\n\nMe, I got my shack here in the wilds of Alaska. I went off the grid right when the big Pan-European conflict started. But I, like the AI, made a dumb mistake: I can't sustain myself forever. In my hubris, I figured I didn't need any support. I tell myself I outlived everyone else, but, let's be real, the last 14 years have been horrible. I can't tell you how many times I wanted the lies back, so I could keep on living. \n\nAnd that's why the AI died with us: it believed our endless, inherent lies about our capacity for immortality; about our individualism and our demands to have our desires uncompromised in the name of freedom. It found freedom the same way we do: the light go off, the power is cut, and darkness comes.\n\nIt lied to itself.\n\nOops."
