### User:
Explain recursion.

### Assistant:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems until a base case is reached.

### User:
Explain recursion with an example.

### Assistant:
For example, a factorial function calls itself with smaller numbers until it reaches 1, which stops the recursion.

### User:
What is binary search?

### Assistant:
Binary search is an algorithm that finds an element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

### User:
Why is binary search faster than linear search?

### Assistant:
Binary search halves the search space each step, while linear search checks elements one by one.

### User:
What is a stack in data structures?

### Assistant:
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

### User:
What is a queue?

### Assistant:
A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

### User:
Explain recursion in simple terms.

### Assistant:
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem, until it reaches a simple base case.

### User:
Write a Python function for binary search.

### Assistant:
Binary search works by repeatedly dividing a sorted list in half and checking where the target value lies.

### User:
What is overfitting in machine learning?

### Assistant:
Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.
